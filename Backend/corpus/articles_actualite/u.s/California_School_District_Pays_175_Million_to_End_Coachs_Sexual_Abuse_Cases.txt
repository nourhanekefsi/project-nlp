In an unexpected legal twist, a school district in Marin County, Calif., has paid $17.5 million to four former high school students who accused a predatory tennis coach of sexually abusing them in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The resolution of the cases culminates a lengthy personal and legal odyssey for the first student to make the accusations, Alex Harrison, who was subsequently blackballed by the insular sporting community there.

The districtâ€™s decision offers a reminder of how much has changed when it comes to reporting abuse and holding institutions accountable since 2006, when Mr. Harrison first told the police about the events at Tamalpais High School in affluent Mill Valley, Calif., north of San Francisco.

Mr. Harrison, now a lawyer in Southern California, had been a star player on the tennis team. But when he first testified against his prominent coach and gym teacher, Normandie Burgos, no one believed him, he said. His teammates, friends and their parents packed the gallery to support the coach.

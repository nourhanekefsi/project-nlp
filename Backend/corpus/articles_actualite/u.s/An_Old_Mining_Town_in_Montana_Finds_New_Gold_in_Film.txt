We’re exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. Residents of the small, historic city of Butte, Mont., have had a front-row seat to a growing local economy.

Paige Layne was several weeks into her new job as a security guard — standing watch outside of the civic center in her hometown of Butte, Mont. — when she found out exactly what it was she had been guarding.

Inside, a team of people was busy working on a set for “1923,” a multimillion-dollar prequel to the hit television show “Yellowstone.” And as word spread, it soon became the talk of the town that the production would be filmed in Butte.

The city was once the largest in the state and home to a copper mining boom a century ago that brought it the nickname “the richest hill on earth.” Since those days, however, the population has declined to about 36,000, the government has undertaken a massive cleanup of mining waste and, for some locals, good-paying jobs have been hard to come by.

Now the town was abuzz with rumored sightings of Harrison Ford imbibing at local watering holes and Helen Mirren shopping at the Walmart.

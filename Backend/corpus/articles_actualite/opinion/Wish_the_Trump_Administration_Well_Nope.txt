Re “Done With Never Trump,” by Bret Stephens (column, Dec. 18):

Mr. Stephens repeats one of those platitudes we often hear as a new president prepares to take office, exhorting us to “enter the new year by wishing the new administration well.”

In normal times I might respect that nice sentiment, but not with this incoming Trump administration. I want them to fail at every horrible thing they try to do.

Does wishing them well include hoping they will have a change of heart, pursue less cruel and destructive policies? Not much chance of that happening under Donald Trump. So I’m sorry, Bret, but I can’t bring myself to wish them well.

To the Editor:

It is with great sadness that I read Bret Stephens’s column “Done With Never Trump,” which I interpreted as a throwing in the towel moment from someone I consider to be one of the most principled, respected and influential conservative thinkers of the day (whose members include David French, Bill Kristol, George F. Will and Liz Cheney).

The airlines are magicians.

They’ve positioned flying as a minor part of the environmental crisis using distraction, manipulation and psychology. And we want to believe in their fantasy of air travel that doesn’t roast the planet.

The industry is responsible for about 4 percent of human-made climate change, an enormous amount given that only about 10 percent of the global population flies regularly. New technology and efficiency gains, the airlines say, will allow them to expand their number of frequent fliers, and reach the 7 billion people who don’t fly, without additional harm to the environment.

My Ph.D. dissertation was on jet engines, and I don’t see a credible path for the aviation industry to make flying sustainable in the near term. Once I realized this 13 years ago, I stopped flying for leisure. It seemed the least I could do to help people who are most affected by climate change.

In Europe, where you can reach many places by train, the European Commission has taken the airlines to court for greenwashing. Nearly one-fifth of Germans claim to have flown less because of environmental concerns, and France recently banned domestic flights between cities where a rail alternative under 2.5 hours exists.

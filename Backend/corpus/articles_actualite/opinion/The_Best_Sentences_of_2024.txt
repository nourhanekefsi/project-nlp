This year more than usual, those of you who wrote to me asked where you should find hope. Where you should find joy. Where, at a minimum, you should find a reprieve.

In language. That’s one of my answers. To read what some of the most talented writers can do is to be reassured of human ingenuity, human sensitivity, human spark. We’re a cunning and capable species, even if we spend much of our time (and many of our elections) trying to prove otherwise.

As I reviewed the passages of journalism featured in the For the Love of Sentences section of my Times Opinion newsletter in 2024 so that I could showcase anew (and put a holiday-season bow on) some of the best ones, I had my faith in humanity restored. Well, somewhat. I smiled. I laughed. I also cursed a few of the authors for a verbal wizardry denied most of us mortals, but it was an appreciative cursing. It was envy alchemized into glee. And paired with gratitude to the newsletter readers who spotted and submitted these gems and so many others. Thank you very much.

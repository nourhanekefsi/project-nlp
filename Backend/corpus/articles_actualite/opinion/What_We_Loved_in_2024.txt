The Movies, Memes, Habits, and Hobbies That Took Us Far, Far Away in 2024

The Movies, Memes, Habits, and Hobbies That Took Us Far, Far Away in 2024

Endless wars, expensive groceries, extreme weather — those are just some of the issues in the E section of our index of things we’d prefer to have skipped in 2024. So we asked Times Opinion staff members to share how they escaped it all this year. These are the habits we started, the ones we quit, the culture that brought comfort and the memes that made us laugh so hard, we momentarily achieved a state of Zen. This is what we’ll carry with us as we turn the page to 2025.

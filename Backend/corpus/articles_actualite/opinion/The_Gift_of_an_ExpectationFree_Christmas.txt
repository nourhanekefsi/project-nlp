It was Christmas night, 2019. At the table beside ours, a recent widow told me about her late husband. My daughter, 11 years old then, bopped between a couple of strollers, each holding a tiny wagging dog. Their owners were older women, at least one of whom had retired from a career in theater — which she said in three syllables (“thee-AY-ter”). Couples laughed and sang a Christmas carol, and our glasses were never empty.

This unlikely gaggle of strangers, some of us in mourning, others just orphaned by fate, came together in a hotel bar and restaurant in Palm Springs, Calif., on this familiest of family holidays. It was probably the freest Christmas of my life.

My father died six days earlier. He was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive soft tissue cancer two weeks before his death. He’d avoided going to the doctor for as long as he could, and when he was finally diagnosed, we knew he didn’t have long, but we assumed a few months, at least.

Within hours of his death, my daughter and I flew from our home in Washington, D.C., to Arizona, where he’d lived. We met my brother, Joshua, who had traveled from New Jersey — and we embarked on the sobering tasks required of death in America. We arranged for cremation, ordered death certificates, canceled credit cards. I said a final goodbye, alone, to my father at a funeral home.

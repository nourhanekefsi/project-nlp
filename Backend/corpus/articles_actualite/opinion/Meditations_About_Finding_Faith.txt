Re “My Decade-Long Journey to Belief,” by David Brooks (column, Dec. 22):

Mr. Brooks’s revelations about spiritual and religious seeking are profound and interesting. For many “faith” seems to be a take it or leave it proposition. As we mature we think of it as a rational decision to believe in God or not. But there is a different model.

Perhaps faith is not a decision but an instinct — something so intrinsic to being human that it cannot be ignored. Instinct permeates the animal world from butterflies flying to Mexico to babies suckling on their mother’s breast. These are not rational behaviors; they are intrinsic to being in the animal world.

The search for the higher, the better, even the perfect seems intrinsic to humans. Religion is a manifestation to pursue this good as a group. But there are over 200 religions in the world. They cannot all be right.

Religion is an effort to satiate our spiritual instinct. Whether it does so is up to the individual to determine. Some of us thrive on that need to connect with like-minded individuals. But to me the instinct to seek a spiritual plane whether we embrace religion or not is as natural and intrinsic to being human as it is for the sun to come up over the horizon in the morning.

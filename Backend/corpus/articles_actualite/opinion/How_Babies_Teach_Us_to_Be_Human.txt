Every year as I’m unpacking my grandmother’s nativity set, I hide the ceramic baby in a drawer. My grandmother installed the baby in the manger on the first day of Advent, but it’s a tradition in this house to wait till Christmas morning. I like the reminder of an empty manger: Advent is a time for waiting.

When my youngest was hardly more than a baby himself, it became his job to hide the nativity baby from all of us and bring him out again on Christmas Day. My boy had solemnly claimed this responsibility for himself, and I couldn’t hurt his feelings by reassigning it to one of his older brothers, who might be less apt to drop a ceramic figure that could never be replaced. But unlike the shepherd and the wise man, whose heads are now glued on, and the cow, who is missing both horns, the baby is still in one piece all these years later. It may qualify as a Christmas miracle that my grandmother’s baby Jesus still spends Advent safely tucked into a drawer.

It’s the old nativity set, mended but still itself, now merged with memories of my own babies in Christmases past, that makes me marvel every year at the perfection of the Christmas story. If I were trying to write a story of love and belonging and healing, a story for all — whatever they believe, whoever they might be — I hope it would occur to me, too, to start with a baby. For how is it possible not to love a baby?

This is what babies do: They make us love them. No matter how closed our hearts, no matter how battered and crusted over with scars, along comes a baby and the carapace softens. A baby fills us with more love than we knew we were capable of feeling. Again and again, we scoop the baby up and hold it close to us, feeling its small head nestle into the small hollow above our own collarbone. Again and again, we undo its swaddling clothes and marvel at its tiny red feet.

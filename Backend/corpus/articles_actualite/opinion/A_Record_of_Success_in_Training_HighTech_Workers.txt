Training programs that successfully prepare underemployed men and women for cutting-edge tech careers are exceedingly rare. The work force development organization known as Per Scholas has been doing exactly that for nearly 30 years â€” free of charge to the men and women whose lives have been transformed by its programs. This record of success makes Per Scholas more than worthy of your support.

The program started out in the South Bronx in 1995, teaching young people to refurbish computers for distribution to local schools. The organization has since become a national work force training provider with locations in 24 cities, preparing workers for careers in information technology, cloud computing, software engineering and cybersecurity. Learners who participate can expect 30 to 40 hours of class work per week and three hours a day of post-class studying for 12 to 15 weeks.

Per Scholas works closely with leading tech employers on matters of curriculum, ensuring that its students have in-demand skills when they graduate. One of those employers is Barclays Bank, which has partnered with the program for more than a decade and has hired almost 70 graduates. Barclays helped with a cybersecurity curriculum and worked with Per Scholas to launch campuses in Brooklyn and Newark.

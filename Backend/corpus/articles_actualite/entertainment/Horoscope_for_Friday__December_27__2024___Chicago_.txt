Moon alert

Avoid shopping or important decisions from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. After that, the moon moves from Scorpio into Sagittarius.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

A positive day

Be aware of the restrictions of the moon alert today if shopping or handling negotiations. However, this is a wonderful day to socialize and have fun! Enjoy sports events and activities with kids. Accept invitations for lunch, dinner or happy hour!

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

An average day

This is an upbeat day for you because you might make some financial decisions that affect home and family. If so, avoid doing this during the moon alert. Be smart because timing is everything. Meanwhile, if you can do something different to shake up your routine, you’ll be happy.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

An average day

Conversations with partners, spouses and friends will be energetic today. You will both have something to say! Certainly, travel plans appeal. However, discussions about higher education, medicine, the law and publishing will interest you.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

An average day

This can be a productive day for you, especially if you want to wrap up old business. Be reasonable. Don’t set your sights too high. If spending money or making important decisions, check the moon alert. Work-related discussions might yield imaginative ideas.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)

A positive day

This is a productive day for artists and people working on creative projects because your imagination is heightened, especially during the moon alert. It will be easy for you to think out of the box. This is also great day to socialize! Make plans to get out and have some fun!

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

A positive day

It will please you to hunker down at home today to catch up on old business — some of those odd jobs you’ve been meaning to do. Get these out of the way and then make plans to socialize later. (Your reward.) Sports events, fun activities with kids and exciting outings will delight.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

A positive day

You’ll be persuasive today if you need to get somebody to go along with your ideas. (This is a lovely influence for those in sales, marketing, teaching, acting and writing.) Although home and family are your strong focus now, some fun socializing will appeal.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)

An average day

Your financial ideas are worthy of consideration today. Don’t hesitate to bounce them off your boss or an authority figure because they might fly. Meanwhile, you will enjoy entertaining at home today because you’re eager to communicate to others. Alternatively, perhaps a short trip?

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

An average day

Today the moon is in your sign after the moon alert is over. Although this heightens your feelings, it also improves your luck a tiny bit. Why not test it? Ask the universe for a favor. After all, timing is everything, and when the moon is in your sign, things tend to go your way.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

An average day

Today is full of contradictory energies. With the sun in your sign, of course, you’re strong and confident. You will attract people to you. However, the moon is hiding in your chart and perhaps encouraging some financial wheeling and dealing. In fact, you might attract money to you.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

A positive day

A conversation with a friend, perhaps someone younger, could be significant today. They might have views about someone else, perhaps your partner or another friend or even members of the general public. Meanwhile, you’re charming and affable.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

A positive day

This is a popular time for you because you are making an effort to see friends and interacting with clubs and organizations. Today in particular, you are noticed more than usual by others. In fact, some people will know personal details about your private life.

If your birthday is today

Actor Masi Oka (1974) shares your birthday today. You are charming, generous and loyal, especially to family. You have a distinctive style that is appealing. This year has been quieter, with a stronger focus on relationships and your personal life. Next year is a fun-loving year to live it up! Let your hair down and enjoy yourself.

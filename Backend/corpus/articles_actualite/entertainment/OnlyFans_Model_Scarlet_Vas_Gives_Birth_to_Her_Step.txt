OnlyFans model Scarlet Vas and her stepbrother — and husband — Tayo Ricci have welcomed their first child together.

Vas, 29, and Ricci, 27, announced their baby’s arrival via Instagram in a series of photos posted on Thursday, December 26.

The first photo in the post showed the proud parents cradling their newborn daughter, who was born on Christmas Day. Another image featured a closeup of the baby’s hand being held by mom and dad.

The infant’s face was obscured by an emoji and Vas and Ricci did not reveal their daughter’s name.

“Our Christmas miracle has finally arrived🤍,” they captioned the joint Instagram post. “Merry Christmas from our family to yours.”

Vas, who played Mishti Sharma on Australian soap Neighbours from 2017 to 2018, announced her pregnancy in September. She had been documenting her journey toward motherhood via social media in the months since.

The couple originally met through mutual friends as teenagers in Australia before tying the knot in Mykonos, Greece in September 2023. Two of their parents later married themselves, making Vas and Ricci stepsiblings. It is unclear which of the pair’s parents tied the knot but Vas has said in past TikTok videos that she and Ricci share a mother.

Despite facing some backlash for their relationship, Vas told news.com.au in a September interview that they were not taking the criticism to heart.

“Honestly, it doesn’t affect us because we have each other,” she told the outlet. “I don’t really read our comments section, but if I do, I actually laugh. We find trolls very entertaining.”

Vas added, “If something’s really negative, we might comment back, we find it is quite a good disarming tactic.”

The social media star emphasized that she and Ricci are not “blood related”.

“We were about 13 years old when we first met through mutual friends, our families knew each other and they introduced us I guess you could say,” she explained. “So we’ve known each other for a very long time.”

Vas has also been outspoken about leaving behind her acting pursuits for a lucrative career on the adult subscription service OnlyFans.

She opened up to the “Uncensored Podcast” in May 2023 about how much money she’s making posting content by herself as well as alongside Ricci.

“I’m in the 0.01%, like the lowest you can go on OF. But every month’s been getting better. ‘Like last month was my best month. I hit almost $200k and then this month I’m going to do well over $200k,” she said. “I mean the fans love us as, like, a thing or not a thing. He’s my stepbrother and Australian and we’ve known each other for a very long time.”

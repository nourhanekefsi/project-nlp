Cynthia Erivo knows how to do this. Erivo has already dazzled audiences with her powerhouse performances on stage and screen. Still, her turn as Elphaba in Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked” has cemented her place as one of her generation’s most versatile and captivating artists.

The first half of the two-part Wicked saga is already a sensation, and Erivo’s portrayal of the misunderstood green-skinned witch is winning accolades. Yet, as she reveals to Variety’s Awards Circuit Podcast, this journey is far more than just a career milestone — it’s personal.

In her approach to Elphaba, Erivo drew on her own experiences. “I know what it feels like to walk into a room where people don’t want you to be there,” Erivo shares on this week’s episode. “I know what it feels like to be bullied, to feel rejected, to feel like you’re not loved. Bringing those memories to the surface wasn’t easy, but it was necessary to show Elphaba’s vulnerability and resilience.” Listen below!

Accolades have rained upon the stunning British artist throughout her career, with only an Oscar to go to complete her “EGOT.” If she wins Best Actress, Erivo will be the first actor to complete her EGOT on the Oscar stage.

Erivo’s interpretation of the role that Idina Menzel originated on Broadway captures Elphaba’s complexity, showcasing her evolution from an outcast to a symbol of strength. Still, she didn’t want to belt out every note. Erivo says she wanted to earn her melodic power with the audience. “When I first sing as Elphaba, it’s almost spoken — tentative, unsure. She hasn’t earned the right to soar yet. By the time she gets to ‘Defying Gravity,’ it’s not just a song; it’s a declaration of power,” Erivo explains.

One of the most talked-about aspects of the film is the emotional connection between Elphaba and Glinda, played by Ariana Grande. One of the key moments is during the Ozdust Ballroom scene, seeing the two divas exchanging emotions in a powerful wordless dance number.

Reflecting on the scene, Erivo says, “The dance we share is an act of forgiveness. It’s Elphaba saying, ‘You hurt me, but I’m willing to start again.’ Forgiveness is one of the hardest things we can do, and this moment needed to show that. Ariana and I worked closely to bring authenticity to our relationship. We wanted the audience to feel the bond between them and the pain of their choices.”

Beyond “Wicked,” Erivo is channeling her artistry into music. She reveals exclusively to Variety that her debut album will drop next year, just before the release of “Wicked: For Good. “The album is eclectic, blending soul, country, and pop,” she says. “My voice is the backbone — I’ve even used it as an instrument for layering sounds.”

The release is deeply personal for Erivo, who views music as a therapeutic outlet. “I’ve worked so hard on this album. It’s an extension of me and a reflection of all the influences that have shaped my life.”

For the second part of “Wicked,” Erivo worked closely with composer Stephen Schwartz to create an original song for Elphaba. “I collaborated on one of the new songs, and it’s so special to me,” she shares. “When we filmed it, the entire crew was in tears. I hope audiences are ready — it’s a song that speaks to the heart of who Elphaba is.”

She also teases the darker, more mature tone of the second film. “We’re diving deeper into the consequences of the characters’ choices. The story is richer, and the stakes are higher. It’s not just a continuation; it’s a transformation.”

Countless social media videos of viewers recording themselves after the closing credits show people in tears. If you’re familiar with the stage adaptation, I’m not sure we’re ready, as a nation, to see Erivo and Grande sing “For Good” from Act II. It’s sure to be a heart-wrenching moment of reconciliation, which Erivo reveals left even the cast and crew in tears during filming.

Erivo is passionate about challenging traditional notions of good and evil in “Wicked.”

“Elphaba isn’t wicked. None of the characters are purely good or bad. They’re flawed, complex, and human,” Erivo says. “This story asks us to reconsider the labels we place on others and ourselves. It’s about empathy and understanding. The world needs more of that right now.”

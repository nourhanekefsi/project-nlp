Or Female Rage: The Musical. Taylor Swift spent the year on a historic roll with the Eras Tour, but that wasn’t enough melodrama for her, so she devised a 31-track song cycle full of seismic mood swings. It’s a big, messy, wildly chaotic, furiously cathartic sprawl, lurching from oddball experiments to dead-on-the-money heartbreak. It’s full of pop sparkle like the New Romantic synth-disco of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” or the alien petulance of “Down Bad,” raging at a hot English rock star I humbly pray I never have to think about again. But in the great double-album tradition, it has sleepers that take months to sneak up on you — in my case, I thought “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” was total garbage until I saw a stranger karaoke it while she crawled on the floor. Tortured Poets might seem like a departure, or maybe a sadistic scam to keep delaying Debutation TV. But it’s Taylor doing what she’s done all year—all her career — which is dreaming up impossible things, then making them happen, until it starts to seem impossible that they never happened before.

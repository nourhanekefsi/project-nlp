Two sailors taking part in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race died in separate accidents overnight during wild weather, the Australian authorities said Friday. These were first deaths in decades during the annual race, which is one of the most prestigious in the world.

The annual 628-nautical-mile race, which began Thursday in Sydney, attracts teams from around the globe. It is known for challenging conditions that in the past have sunk yachts as they made their way south to Hobart, the state capital of Tasmania. But it has been 26 years since it last claimed lives, when six sailors died during the 1998 race in severe storms.

The Australian police said that the two men who died on Thursday night and early Friday were both struck on the head by booms, a horizontal beam that attaches the sail of a ship to the mast, and swings as the wind moves the sail from side to side.

Since armed rebels entered Damascus, Syria, and overthrew the reign of President Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8, U.S. government officials have been waiting to see if any remnants of the former regimeâ€™s stockpiles of chemical weapons would be found.

None are known to have turned up so far. If they did, it is unclear what might happen to them or who would be responsible for disposing of them. But a U.S. military mission to destroy Syrian chemical weapons a decade ago could offer the White House some viable options.

About a year and a half after the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, Maj. Gen. Jay G. Santee found himself in a meeting at the Pentagon discussing a hypothetical problem.

At the time, he was the deputy director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a military office that looks for ways to prevent adversaries from attacking the United States with weapons of mass destruction.

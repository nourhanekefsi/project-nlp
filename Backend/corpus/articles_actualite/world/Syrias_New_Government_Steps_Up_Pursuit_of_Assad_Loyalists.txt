Syria’s new administration has stepped up its campaign to track down and arrest members of the ousted Assad dictatorship, signaling that it would act with a heavy hand against people suspected of atrocities against Syrians.

Sana, the state-run Syrian news agency, reported on Saturday that “a number of remnants of the Assad militias” were arrested in the coastal Latakia region in western Syria. Weapons and ammunitions were confiscated, the report added.

The new administration, which has tried to assert its authority over Syria since an alliance of rebels toppled President Bashar al-Assad three weeks ago, has signaled that pursuing loyalists of the Assad dictatorship is a top priority.

But a human rights organization has raised alarms about the way the transitional government was going after Assad loyalists, saying it was carrying out arbitrary arrests of supporters of the old regime.

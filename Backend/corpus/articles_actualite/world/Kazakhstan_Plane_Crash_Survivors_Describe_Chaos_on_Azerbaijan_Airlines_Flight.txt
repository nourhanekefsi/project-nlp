At first, there was a strange banging noise outside the plane. Then, while one flight attendant was standing in the cabin, something hit his arm, cutting it. The passengers, sensing something was terribly wrong, began panicking. Some began praying.

One passenger recalled thinking it would be the last prayer of his life. Then, silence.

The anxious and chaotic scene on board Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 was described by two flight attendants — Zulfugar Asadov and Aydan Rahimli — and a passenger, Subhonkul Rakhimov, in interviews with The New York Times on Friday and with an Azerbaijani TV station.

They were among the 29 survivors from the plane that set off on Wednesday with 67 people on board from Baku, Azerbaijan, en route to Grozny, Russia, and that crashed in a ball of black smoke and orange flames on the shores of the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. The pilots were among those who did not survive, officials said.

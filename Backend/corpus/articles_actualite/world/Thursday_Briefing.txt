Russia released a wave of attacks on Ukraine

Early Christmas morning, air-raid alarms and explosions sounded in Ukraine as dozens of Russian missiles and drones targeted the nation’s energy infrastructure.

Rescue workers and energy repair crews raced to assess the damage as missiles streaked through the skies. At least six people were wounded in Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, and one person was killed in Dnipro, and officials said that the toll from strikes around the country might rise.

The Ukrainian military said air defense teams had shot down 59 missiles and had either shot down or disabled most of the drones used in the attack. Ukraine’s largest private energy company said the attacks caused serious damage to equipment; power outages were also declared across the country.

Quotable: “Today, Putin deliberately chose Christmas for an attack,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a statement. “What could be more inhuman?”

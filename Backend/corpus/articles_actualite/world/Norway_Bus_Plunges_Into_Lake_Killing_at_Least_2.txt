A bus in Norway veered off the road and plunged partway into a frigid lake on Thursday, killing at least three people and seriously injuring four others, according to the local police.

Fifty-eight passengers were on the bus when it went off the road by Asvatnet lake, in the northwestern part of the country, the police said. The passengers included citizens of at least eight countries besides Norway.

The accident occurred around 1:45 p.m. in Hadsel as the bus was traveling southwest from the remote seaport of Narvik, according to a statement released by Boreal, the bus company.

Working in grueling weather conditions, emergency responders took some rescued passengers to a hospital, while others were evacuated to a nearby school.

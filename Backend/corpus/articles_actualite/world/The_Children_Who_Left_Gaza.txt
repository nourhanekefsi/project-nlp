The Children Who Left Gaza

The children and their caretakers know little of the language or the culture. They know even less of what may happen to them or their loved ones in the months to come.

They do know war.

Sixteen young people, all but one younger than 15, were evacuated from the Gaza Strip early this year after sustaining dire injuries in the war there between Israel and Hamas. The airlifts were the result of painstaking negotiations between aid groups and several governments, including Israel, Egypt and Italy, and each of the wounded was accompanied by a caretaker, usually a relative.

Some of the children had limbs amputated to save their lives. Many will bear scars for life. Most have lost family members, and left behind others whose safety is uncertain. All face uncertain futures, with questions about whether there will ever be a home to return to, or if they should apply for asylum.

“Italy is beautiful, but I need support,” said Lina Gamal, Shaymaa’s aunt and caretaker, listing the many family members she left behind. “As long as I have no one around me, it’s nothing.”

Two days after a plane bound for Russia crashed in Kazakhstan, killing dozens of passengers, the White House said on Friday that there was reason to believe that Russia was responsible.

In a telephone news conference with reporters, John F. Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said there were “some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems.”

“That said, there’s an ongoing investigation right now,” he added. “Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are conducting this jointly. We have offered our assistance to that investigation.”

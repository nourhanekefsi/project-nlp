The Israeli military on Thursday unleashed a significant air assault on parts of Yemen controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia in retaliation for the group’s missile attacks against Israel, striking back at an adversary more than a thousand miles away.

The Israeli assault comes after a week of the Houthis’ near-nightly launches of ballistic missiles and drones against Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously telegraphed Israel’s aim against its foes in the region, saying on Wednesday of Iran’s proxies and the recently toppled government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria: “The Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas, Hezbollah, the Assad regime and others have learned. And even if it takes time, this lesson will be understood across the Middle East.”

On Thursday after the Israeli strikes, Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview with an Israeli TV station of the Houthis: “We are just getting started with them.”

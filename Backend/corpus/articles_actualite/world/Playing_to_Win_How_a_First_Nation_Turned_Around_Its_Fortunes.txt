I didn’t get to take in much of the landscape on my rainy overnight drive to Cape Breton from the other end of the province, where I had been reporting on a forthcoming story related to lobster fishing. Over the course of my interviews, several people suggested that I visit an Indigenous community on Cape Breton Island called Membertou First Nation.

Its entrepreneurial chief, Terry Paul, led a coalition of First Nation groups to make the largest-ever investment by Indigenous people in Canada’s seafood industry in 2021. The coalition acquired 50 percent of Clearwater Seafoods, a company in Nova Scotia, in a deal valued at 1 billion Canadian dollars. In September, Membertou partnered with another First Nation and made a deal to acquire one of the oldest shipyards in Canada.

MLB's Cardinals beat reporter John Denton wrote that the Guardians have "keen interest" in Cardinals pitchers Erick Fedde and Steven Matz:

The Cleveland Guardians are interested in Erick Fedde or Steven Matz, per @JohnDenton555 pic.twitter.com/alwEF9mRGA â€” La Mole (@FranmilsEyebrow) December 27, 2024

Adding one proven veteran arm, especially if it is Fedde, would really make me feel a lot better about this team.

It wasn't exactly a quiet Christmas Day for Halo this year, as although Halo Studios hasn't got anything to announce right now, some random poster on 4chan decided to leak 90GB worth of content relating to the franchise.

That's according to a report from The Game Post, which mentions that the leak was for the "Halo Digsite Archive" - a resource that modders have previously used to help 343 Industries restore old content from early Halo games.





Today a 90GB Halo Digsite Archive got posted.

It contains some Builds, Tools, docs etc from various Halo Titles.

A lot of the group left. Things might not have gotten much further work tbh. Either way it's all out now — 𝘑𝘖𝘏𝘕 (@DogbrainLudus) December 26, 2024

The person called "John" (seen in the tweet above) used to work on the Halo Digsite project, and advised that nobody is aware of who caused the leak yet, and it actually contains some .dll files that he didn't have access to.

It was a bit of a controversial project amongst some people who worked on it as well, as there never appeared to be a financial incentive - something that John says "is what it is", and that he was doing it simply for the "love of the game".

It is what it is/was what it was. Halo CE for myself at least was totally love of the game and I was overjoyed seeing reactions to H2E3. Just hoping for the best with this stuff. — 𝘑𝘖𝘏𝘕 (@DogbrainLudus) December 26, 2024

Anyway, the TL;DR is that a big leak for classic Halo titles has arrived on the internet, and we may start seeing a bunch of leaked content over the coming days and weeks. It doesn't appear that anything relating to the future of the franchise is part of this though - it's mainly focused on everything from Halo 1 up to Halo: The Master Chief Collection.

Beneath the azure waves of the Aegean Sea, researchers are delving into the mysteries of Kolumbo, an underwater volcano near Santorini. Recent investigations led by the University of Athens and the Hellenic Center for Marine Research (HCMR) have uncovered groundbreaking insights into this volatile giant. Through two pioneering research programs, Santory and Thira, scientists deployed sophisticated equipment into Kolumbo’s 500-meter-deep crater to monitor its activity and create detailed time series data, a first for this volcano.

The studies confirmed Kolumbo’s high activity levels. State-of-the-art tools, including sensors measuring temperature, pressure, pH, CO₂, hydrogen sulfide, and turbidity, recorded significant findings. Cameras captured vivid visuals of hydrothermal chimneys venting fluids at a scorching 230C, rich with carbon dioxide. Active hydrothermal systems like this demand constant monitoring, as changes in emissions could signal eruptive behavior, according to Professor Evi Nomikou, head of the Santory project.

The work also included seismographs and inclinometer measurements that allowed scientists to track underwater currents and tectonic shifts. A parallel mission and in cooperation with Santory, Multi-Marex, backed by German funding, is set to deploy 26 underwater seismographs in the heart of the volcano. At the same time, a 3D seismic imaging will be carried out on the Amorgos fault, which caused a catastrophic 1956 earthquake.

The findings are not confined to scientific circles. The Thira initiative brought volcanic awareness into Santorini’s schools, fostering a deeper understanding of volcanic hazards in a community living near Kolumbo. While municipal funding has lapsed, researchers advocate continued support to ensure the data flow aids long-term volcanic monitoring.

Kolumbo exemplifies how cutting-edge technology, international collaboration, and local engagement can converge to illuminate the complexities of the Earth’s volatile undersea landscapes, safeguarding both knowledge and lives.

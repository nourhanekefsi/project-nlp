Merry Christmas to the “wonderful soldiers of China” and to “Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada” and “the people of Greenland.” As for the 37 men on federal death row who recently received commutations from President Biden? “GO TO HELL!”

The messages, posted online by President-elect Donald J. Trump on Christmas, were characteristic for a man known for his bombastic social media presence, but they veered sharply from the standard holiday ideals of unity delivered from the White House.

The posts, which appeared on Truth Social, the online platform owned by Mr. Trump’s media company, labeled his opponents as “Radical Left Lunatics,” and once again described the current president as “Sleepy Joe Biden.”

Mr. Trump’s Christmas comments also hinted at what could be his priorities come Jan. 20, as he spoke about asserting U.S. control over the Panama Canal and Greenland, which he covets for its reserves of rare earth minerals needed for advanced technology.

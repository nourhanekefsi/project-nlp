As U.S. officials engage with the rebel group now in control of Syria, they are mindful of a painful episode in recent U.S. foreign policy whose consequences continue to unfold: the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

Three U.S. diplomats met last week in Damascus, Syria’s capital, with leaders of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel militia that recently toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Their goal was to persuade the militant group — the successor to an affiliate of Al Qaeda — to govern the country with an inclusive and moderate hand.

That is the best hope, U.S. officials believe, for preventing Syria from descending into fresh violence and chaos that could further destabilize the Middle East and empower anti-American terrorist groups.

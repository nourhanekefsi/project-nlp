Heading into the holiday shopping season this year, retailers said they expected consumers to be more discerning — motivated by deals rather than a once-a-year gift splurge. To keep them spending, companies as varied as electronics stores and beauty brands said they would be pushing promotions.

The bargains seem to have worked.

Total spending for the holiday period, from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, rose 3.8 percent, according to data released on Thursday by Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. That’s above Mastercard SpendingPulse’s estimate of 3.2 percent for this year and more than last year, when growth was 3.1 percent.

Online sales stood out, rising 6.7 percent compared with a gain of about 2.9 percent for in-store sales. The data is not adjusted for inflation.

Spending is a perennial measure of consumer health: Inflation, nervousness about the job market and even a contentious outcome to the presidential election each could have hampered sales. But after a year of restraining themselves, shoppers instead decided to take advantage of the discounts. The last five days of the holiday season accounted for 10 percent of all holiday spending, the Mastercard SpendingPulse data showed.

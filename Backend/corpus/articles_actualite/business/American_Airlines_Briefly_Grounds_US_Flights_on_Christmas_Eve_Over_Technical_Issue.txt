Thousands of travelers trying to make it to their loved ones for the holidays were stuck at airports through much of Tuesday after American Airlines briefly grounded all its flights in the United States because of a technical issue and bad weather made those delays worse.

The worst of the troubles were centered at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, which is American Airlines’s largest hub and is one of the country’s busiest airports.

The travel problems began on Tuesday morning when systems that are needed to release flights malfunctioned because of what American said in a statement was a vendor technology issue. Then came the weather: A system of storms that prompted a flood warning moved into the Dallas area and hundreds of flights were delayed even after the technical issue was resolved about an hour later.

By Tuesday night, only 15 percent of American Airlines flights at Dallas Fort Worth had departed on time, according to Cirium, an aviation data company. And earlier, the airline also requested that a ground stop for flights headed to the airport. That stop lasted for over four hours until about 8:30 p.m.

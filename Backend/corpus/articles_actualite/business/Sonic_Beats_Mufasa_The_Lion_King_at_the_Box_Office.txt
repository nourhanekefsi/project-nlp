Disney’s mighty Mufasa … eaten alive by a hedgehog?

“Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” directed by Jeff Fowler, arrived in North American theaters as an instant hit: The adventure comedy collected roughly $62 million in its first weekend in theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. (Analysts had estimated on Saturday morning that “Sonic 3” could go as high as $70 million, but demand softened a bit as the weekend went on.)

The PG-rated sequel to a sequel cost Paramount Pictures about $122 million to make, not including marketing costs. Ticket buyers gave “Sonic 3” an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls and reviews were mostly positive, setting up the fuzzy blue speedball for strong word of mouth among families over the Christmas holiday.

In second place, “Mufasa: The Lion King,” a photorealistic “Lion King” prequel, collected around $35 million — about 30 percent less than what Disney had expected. “Mufasa,” which cost more than $200 million to make, not including marketing, received an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. Reviews were weak.

Adding to the humiliation for Disney, “Mufasa” had a wider release than “Sonic 3” did — 4,100 theaters compared with 3,761. Moreover, “Mufasa” was booked at 400 IMAX theaters, where tickets sell for a premium price. “Sonic 3” was not shown in any IMAX locations.

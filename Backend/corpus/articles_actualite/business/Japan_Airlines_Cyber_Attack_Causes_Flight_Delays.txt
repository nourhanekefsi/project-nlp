Japan Airlines operations were disrupted by a cyberattack on Thursday morning, causing delays to both domestic and international flights.

For part of the day, the airline stopped booking tickets for flights departing on Thursday, and its mobile app was temporarily disabled.

In an update on Thursday afternoon, Japan Airlines, known as JAL, said it had resumed sales of same-day tickets and restored the system that had been affected by the cyberattack. It said no customer information was leaked.

JAL had said earlier that at 7:24 a.m., it identified a problem with equipment connecting the companyâ€™s internal systems to external networks. About 90 minutes later, JAL temporarily shut down the router device responsible for the problems.

Nobody knows what will send the stock market into a tailspin, or when that moment may be coming. This is the inherent risk that comes with investing.

But some investors are concerned that President-elect Donald J. Trump’s policy agenda — stiff tariffs, deep federal spending cuts, mass deportations of immigrants — could push the market over the edge, inflicting real damage to the investment portfolios they worked so hard to build.

When we asked New York Times readers to send us their money-related questions after the presidential election, these market concerns ranked high. Several asked what financial advisers are suggesting that people do to protect their savings, whether they’re earmarked for retirement or college tuition. Another told us she was considering selling all of her stocks in January. “Is it wise to do that?” she wondered.

The president-elect does pay close attention to the stock market and seems to view its performance as a reflection of his own. Some experts have said they expect the market’s influence to act as a check on Mr. Trump’s policy decisions.

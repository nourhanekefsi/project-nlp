Nordstrom, one of the country’s oldest department stores, said Monday that it would be taken private by its founding family and a Mexican retail business, reaching an agreement after months of speculation over a potential buyout of the business.

The company will be acquired by members of the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool, a Mexican real estate and department store company that has owned a stake in Nordstrom since 2022. Including debt, the deal values Nordstrom at $6.25 billion, the company said in a statement.

Shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock, the company said. That’s about 42 percent higher than its closing price on March 18, when news of a potential sale was first reported, the company said. A month later, Nordstrom said it had formed a special committee of its board of directors to weigh an offer from Erik and Pete Nordstrom.

The company said Monday that it would also authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share if the transaction closed.

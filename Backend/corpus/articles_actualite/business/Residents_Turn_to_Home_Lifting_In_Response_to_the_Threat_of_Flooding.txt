Shortly after moving into their home in St. Petersburg, Fla., Meghan Martin and her husband noticed a drawback to their new neighborhood. The quiet streets of Shore Acres, a leafy community bisected by canals, occasionally flooded. On some days it was easiest for Dr. Martin, a pediatric E.R. doctor, to reach the hospital by paddle board — a feat she once demonstrated in a widely viewed TikTok.

The Martins settled into their one-story “fixer-upper,” painting the exterior cornflower blue and revamping the 1950s kitchen with new appliances and a herringbone backsplash behind the countertop. But they stopped short of a more radical renovation: the house lift. A handful of water-wary neighbors had pushed their living quarters eight to 10 feet in the air, adding space for a garage or storage underneath. The couple balked when they learned the cost could exceed the value of their home, which they bought in 2016 for $265,000. Besides, to their knowledge, the house had never severely flooded.

Two floods — and two rounds of ripping out drywall and throwing away sodden carpets and toys — later, the Martins reconsidered. This year, they put down a deposit on the cheapest option for raising their home — $375,000.

Tesla’s sales of electric cars have stalled. But Wall Street doesn’t seem to be worried.

Investors have taken an optimistic view of the company’s progress in autonomous driving and bet that its chief executive, Elon Musk, will use his new influence in Washington to Tesla’s benefit. Even after a decline on Friday, the company’s share price has risen nearly 80 percent since early November.

The increase in the value of Mr. Musk’s 13 percent stake in Tesla has cemented his status as the richest person on the planet. After spending more than $250 million to support Donald J. Trump, he has become so close to the president-elect that some people have begun referring to him as “co-president.”

Still, stagnant sales at Tesla do not bode well for the company or for overall sales of electric vehicles, which are seen as an essential tool against climate change. While carmakers like General Motors and Hyundai are offering a growing selection of electric vehicles, Tesla still accounts for almost half of all electric car sales in the United States and sets the tone for technology.

Mr. Musk has been vocal about many topics on X, the social media platform he owns. He regularly discusses government spending he believes is wasteful, immigrants he blames for crime and his conviction that “woke mind virus is one of the biggest threats to the existence of humanity.”

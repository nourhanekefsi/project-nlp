The party isn’t over but, it’s winding down.

Going-out-of-business sales have begun at Party City stores across the country.

On Thursday morning, customers were shopping at the eight-aisle Party City store at the Paxton Towne Centre on Jonestown Road in Lower Paxton Township.

Signs in the windows said “Store closing” and “Nothing held back.”

Discounts are running from five to 50% off at the stores known for its party decorations and plastic tableware.

Costumes are 50% off; items for New Years are 20% off; plastic tableware is 5% off; kids’ birthday items are 20% off and greeting cards are 30 % off.

Gordon Brothers is holding the closing sales for New Jersey-based Party City. Gordon Brothers announced on Monday that the sales had started. Party City also recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The closing of the Party City store on Jonestown Road means another vacant space at Paxton Towne Centre. The former Catherines store is now home to a temporary hiring center for the future Academy Sports store. A small adjacent spot next to Catherines is vacant. Renovations are underway for the former Weis store adjacent to Party City, which will be home to Academy Sports.

The Paxton Towne Centre won’t be the only shopping center left with an empty Party City space. The retailer is closing 25 stores across the Keystone state.

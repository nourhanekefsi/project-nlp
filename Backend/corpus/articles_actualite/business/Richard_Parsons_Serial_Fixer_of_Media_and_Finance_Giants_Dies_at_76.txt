Richard D. Parsons, whose humane approach to business made him a serial troubleshooter at distressed companies including Time Warner, CBS and Citigroup and a sought-after adviser at the highest echelons of American industry, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 76.

The cause was cancer, said Ronald S. Lauder, a member of the Estée Lauder board and one of Mr. Parsons’s oldest friends.

Mr. Parsons’s winding career tracked the biggest companies in American media and finance — and the biggest problems. Time and again, he stepped in when things looked catastrophic and put his smooth leadership style to work, assuaging discontented shareholders.

Mr. Parsons, a jazz-loving oenophile who served on the board of the Apollo Theater and owned a Tuscan winery, rose to the top of the business world in an era when he was frequently the only Black executive in the boardroom. A self-described “Rockefeller Republican,” he spoke out on social justice issues in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, signed a letter protesting a 2021 law that imposed restrictions on Georgia voters, and was a founder of the Equity Alliance, a fund that backs early-stage ventures led by women and people of color.

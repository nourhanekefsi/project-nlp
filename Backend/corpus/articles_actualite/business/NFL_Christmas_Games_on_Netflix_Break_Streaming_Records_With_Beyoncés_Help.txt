The Kansas City Chiefs and the Baltimore Ravens notched big Christmas Day victories on their way to the playoffs, and the Netflix streams of those games reaped record ratings.

An even bigger winner was Beyoncé.

The two games, the Chiefs versus the Pittsburgh Steelers followed by the Ravens against the Houston Texans, each had an average audience of just over 24 million viewers, which made them the most streamed N.F.L. games in history, according to Nielsen data provided by Netflix on Thursday.

But Beyoncé’s halftime performance during the Ravens-Texans game did even better, according to Nielsen, a ratings service. She drew an audience of 27 million. The hashtag #BeyonceBowl ranked above even #Christmas on X, according to Netflix.

The game was streamed, rather than broadcast, as part of a three-season deal between the league and Netflix.

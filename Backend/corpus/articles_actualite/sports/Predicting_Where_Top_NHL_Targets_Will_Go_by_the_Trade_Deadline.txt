We are now exactly 10 weeks away from the NHL’s March 7 trade deadline.

That leaves enough runway for the needs of buyers and sellers to shift before the biggest decisions are made — or for buyers and sellers to switch places. But in a season where there’s already been plenty of trade action, it’s not too soon to try to find some fits between teams and players available on our latest NHL trade big board.

With that in mind, here’s part two of trade-board matchmaker.

GO DEEPER NHL trade matchmaker: LeBrun and Johnston predict where top targets go by the deadline, part 1

Team: San Jose Sharks

Position: F

Shoots: L

Age: 32

Contract term: 2025 UFA

AAV: $5 million

The 32-year-old Granlund leads the Sharks in scoring and is on pace for a career high in points. He’s meant a lot to San Jose off the ice, too, as far as his leadership and influence around the youngsters. He also likes it there. All of which is to say, it’s not a slam dunk he gets dealt before the deadline just because he’s a pending unrestricted free agent. The expectation is that Granlund’s agents, Todd Diamond and Mark Gandler, will have a discussion in the new year with Sharks general manager Mike Grier. But the team will need to balance any potential extension with the kind of offers it’ll get on the trade market, and there will certainly be some. Granlund’s versatility of being able to play all three forward positions with comfort will appeal to contenders. He may also augment his trade value depending on his performance under the spotlight playing for Finland in the 4 Nations Face-Off in February. Looking into my matchmaker crystal ball, let’s make him a Vegas Golden Knight. The Sharks and Knights got together on a trade deadline deal a year ago involving Tomas Hertl. Keeping in mind Granlund’s versatility and the unfortunate reality of always being concerned about Mark Stone’s health, I like the idea for Vegas of adding this kind of depth.

A lot of water has passed under the bridge since Granlund was a first-round pick by the Wild who spent seven seasons playing for the organization. Still, wouldn’t it be a nice homecoming story? Minnesota could really use a forward who can toggle between center and wing while chipping in with some offense. Granlund ticks all of those boxes and should come with an added level of comfort given his familiarity with the organization. The cap aspect will need to be worked out since San Jose doesn’t have any retention spots still open and Minnesota has some added challenges while operating in long-term injured reserve, but those aren’t big enough hurdles to keep this from happening.

Team: Philadelphia Flyers

Position: D

Shoots: R

Age: 30

Contract term: 2027 UFA

AAV: $5.1 million

It wasn’t too long ago that Ristolainen’s contract scared teams, but it’s funny what happens with a 20-minute-a-night, top-four defenseman finds his game more consistently, as he has this season. Suddenly, with the salary cap going up, a $5.1 million cap hit for the next two and a half years isn’t so bad at all. That’s why league sources say the Flyers have indeed received calls this season asking if they would be willing to move Ristolainen. The answer from the Flyers is yes — if there’s a certain price met. They would want a good prospect or young player in return or a combination of a prospect and a pick. And while trading for a player with term on his contract isn’t your typical deadline deal since most contenders prefer rentals, I can see it appealing to a few teams. For example, the Jets. I’d like to see the Jets add the kind of size on the right side of their defense that Ristolainen would bring. And after giving up a first-round pick last season for rental Sean Monahan only to see him leave July 1, and keeping in mind how difficult it is for the Jets to attract free agents to Winnipeg, I like the idea of acquiring a player under contract. So there you have it, I’ve got the Cup-contending Jets taking on Ristolainen.

The Stars made a big splash by acquiring Chris Tanev ahead of last year’s deadline but were unable to retain him in free agency over the summer. They haven’t yet filled that hole on the right side of their blue line. The term remaining on Ristolainen’s contract fits in with the Stars’ win-now window, and the improvements in his game should hold appeal given how few defensive stoppers are expected to be available in the marketplace. Depth is essential for any team gearing up for a long spring, and Dallas is all in on trying to win the Stanley Cup.

Team: Chicago Blackhawks

Position: F

Shoots: L

Age: 33

Contract term: 2025 UFA

AAV: $6 million

LeBrun: Utah HC

The Blackhawks actually haven’t committed yet to trading Hall, although given where they are in the standings, one would imagine that’s the most logical course of action for the veteran pending unrestricted free agent. It hasn’t been the best of seasons for the 33-year-old winger, but something tells me that a move to a Cup contender might ignite a little flash from the former Hart Trophy winner. He’s always been one of the smartest players in the league. The hockey IQ hasn’t dulled even if the skating has slowed down a little. If the Hawks are willing to eat some of Hall’s $6 million cap hit, there’s no question in my mind there will be a market for him. Hall has a modified no-trade clause, so his agent, Darren Ferris, could have a role in helping the Hawks find a suitor. So hear me out here: Utah HC as a buyer! This is only realistic in a world in which Utah stays in the race in the second half. They could use a little more offense. Hall has some brand-name cache that would be fun to bring into the NHL’s newest market, and Utah has plenty of cap room, plus a strong desire to stay in the playoff chase.

The Avs are one of the few top teams who could make room for Hall in their top six, which is likely where a player with his skill set needs to play in order to be most effective. The continued uncertainty around Colorado captain Gabriel Landeskog, who has gone more than two and a half years without playing while recovering from a cartilage transplant in his right knee, makes the need for another left winger more pronounced. Hall may not skate at the same level as earlier in his career, but he’s still faster than average and could hold his own alongside Nathan MacKinnon in top-line duty if needed. At minimum, he would give the Avalanche more lineup flexibility than they enjoy now. The acquisition cost also shouldn’t be too significant for a veteran player unlikely to be part of the long-term solution for the rebuilding Blackhawks.

Will Borgen

Team: New York Rangers

Position: D

Shoots: R

Age: 28

Contract term: 2025 UFA

AAV: $2.7 million

The Rangers just acquired Borgen, but he’s a pending unrestricted free agent and unless New York can somehow stop the bleeding and turn around its season, the Blueshirts will be sellers and open to flipping him. The 6-foot-3, 204-pound Borgen would fit nicely in South Florida. I think in many ways, pending unrestricted free agent David Savard is a more obvious fit for the Panthers given his past relationship in Columbus with Panthers general manager Bill Zito, and it wouldn’t surprise me if Florida tried for Savard if it’s looking for a rental, right-shot D with some physicality who won’t break the bank. But Borgen would be the more under-the-radar move if indeed the Rangers decide to make him available.

The Canucks have struggled since losing Filip Hronek to a significant lower-body injury earlier this month, and they’re not expecting him to play again before February. That’s exposed a gaping need on the right side of the blue line that management has aggressively been trying to address. Enter Borgen, who excels in the less-celebrated parts of the game like penalty killing, which Vancouver can certainly use. The stay-at-home defender is a good skater who should be able to step into a second pairing on a team and brings the kind of size teams view as an added plus come playoff time. Borgen will have plenty of suitors ahead of the deadline, but there may not be anyone more motivated to pursue him than Vancouver.

Team: Seattle Kraken

Position: F

Shoots: L

Age: 32

Contract term: 2025 UFA

AAV: $3.5 million

All signs point to the pending unrestricted free agent winger getting dealt ahead of the deadline if the Kraken aren’t in the playoff chase, which seems rather likely as of now. My understanding is there are several contenders waiting to see if/when Tanev is on the market because they want a crack at him. He brings the kind of grindy game most playoff teams are looking for. He’s an excellent penalty killer who leads Seattle in shorthanded ice time. He won’t back down from anyone. I like the Devils as a fit. They’re looking for a bottom-six boost, and I can picture Tanev finding a nice spot in that Cup-contending lineup that has no shortage of offensive talent but could use a little more sandpaper.

Johnston: Vegas Golden Knights

Vegas went into the NHL’s holiday break with the league’s best points percentage, and there’s a strong expectation it’ll be looking to beef up before the deadline yet again. In fact, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Golden Knights pursue two forwards – one with more offensive ability, and a bottom-sixer to round out other elements of the team. Tanev falls into the latter category and may end up being the strongest player with that skill set available. A high-end skater who plays the game hard, it’s not difficult to imagine him fitting in with a team accustomed to using all four lines to win.

The Seahawks and Bears played the NFL’s lowest-scoring game of the season on Thursday Night Football.

The final score of Seahawks 6, Bears 3 gave a total of just nine points, a full touchdown less than the previous lowest-scoring game of the 2024 season, which was Jaguars 10, Titans 6 in Week 14.

The Seahawks’ six points were the fewest for a winning team this season; the Bears were the 10th team this season to score three or fewer points in a loss.

NFL offenses have been particularly ugly during Christmas week: The first shutout of this season happened on Monday night, when the Saints lost to the Packers 34-0. And the second-fewest points scored by any team this season happened on Wednesday, when the Texans lost to the Ravens 31-2.

The last time two NFL teams combined to score less than nine points in a game was Week 14 of 2023, when the Vikings beat the Raiders 3-0.

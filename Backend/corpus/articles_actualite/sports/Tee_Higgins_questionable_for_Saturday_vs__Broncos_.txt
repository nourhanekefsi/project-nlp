As the Bengals try to keep their slim postseason chances alive this weekend, they may not have receiver Tee Higgins.

Higgins (ankle/knee) is questionable for Saturday’s matchup against the Broncos. He was listed as a limited participant on all three injury reports this week.

Higgins has had to battle through multiple injuries in 2024, appearing in 10 games with seven starts. He’s caught 58 passes for 727 yards with seven touchdowns. He had eight receptions for 58 yards with a TD in last week’s victory over Cleveland.

Receiver Charlie Jones (groin), offensive tackle Amarius Mims (ankle/hand), defensive end Joseph Ossai (illness), and safety Geno Stone (illness) are also questionable. Stone was added to the report on Thursday as a non-participant.

Defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins (illness) and defensive end Sam Hubbard (knee) are out.

Tight end Tanner Hudson (knee) is doubtful after he did not practice all week.

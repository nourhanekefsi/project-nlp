ST. LOUIS â€” Your holiday gathering may have you running to the bathroom: doctors say this is the season for a virus that makes the cold and flu seem pleasant.

Norovirus is a stomach bug that causes vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, pain, nausea, fever, chills, headache and muscle aches.

Dr. Farrin Manian is an Infectious Disease Consultant and Chair of the Medicine Department for Mercy Hospital St. Louis. He reports more patients are coming in with GI symptoms, "which I am very sure majority if not all of them are probably related to norovirus."

Urgent care clinics and physicians like Dr. Mollie Spire are also seeing more people with the bathroom trip inducing virus. "With all the holiday celebrations and people getting together with friends and family, things spread pretty quickly," Dr. Spire explains.

Health experts said norovirus spreads fast because it outlasts. "It is quite stable in the environment, so it is resistant to your typical cleaning products and disinfectants," Dr. Spire said. "Bleach is the best thing to use to disinfect contaminated areas."

The stomach bug is hard not to catch, but both Dr. Spire and Dr. Manian said washing your hands helps. "Washing for at least 30 seconds at a time," Dr. Spire urged.

If you do catch it, the doctor's advice may not be the news you want to hear. "There's no specific antiviral agent that kills norovirus," Dr. Manian said, "you really have to kind of let it run its course."

Doctors said norovirus usually lasts one or two days. Dr. Spire said you can take Pepto-Bismol or Imodium to help mitigate symptoms.

Dr. Manian said dehydration is the most common complication from norovirus. He recommended taking small sips of liquids every 5 to 10 minutes to prevent nausea or worsening existing nausea.

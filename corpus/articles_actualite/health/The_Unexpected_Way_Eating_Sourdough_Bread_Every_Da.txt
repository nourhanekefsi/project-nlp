Sleep is a basic human need, but not everyone gets enough of it. According to the American Psychiatric Assocation, sleep disorders affect 50+ million individuals in the U.S. alone. And if you regularly toss and turn, you understand how frustrating the experience can be. The good news is that natural sleep remedies exist, including unexpected ones like chowing down on sourdough bread. For one, sourdough bread can pamper your gut. For another, it can keep your blood sugar from spiking. Together, those traits make sourdough bread worth trying for improved snoozing.

The more optimally your gut can perform, the greater the impact it can have on other aspects of your health and wellbeing, including your ability to get recuperative sleep. It may seem a little strange at first to connect what happens in the stomach to what happens in the brain. But according to a 2022 review in Sleep Medicine Reviews, stomach health and sleep may be intertwined. The findings showed that disrupted sleep patterns could lead to a disrupted gut, and vice versa. The researchers concluded that focusing on gut health could be one way to reduce disordered sleep behaviors.

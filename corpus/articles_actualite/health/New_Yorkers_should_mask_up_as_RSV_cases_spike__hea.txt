If you’re feeling under the weather this holiday season, you’re not alone.

The number of New Yorkers infected with respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, has jumped since last month, according to the New York City health department. The virus can cause mild, cold-like symptoms, but some people can become seriously ill. Symptoms include a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, chills and a loss of appetite.

Nearly 5,000 cases of RSV were reported to city health authorities in the week ending Dec. 14, health officials said. That number has risen sharply since the beginning of November.

Flu cases have also jumped in December, though not at the rate seen last winter, when the health department received more than 10,000 positive influenza test results.

Differences in severity can vary season by season based on a number of factors, including whether people seek care for their symptoms, according to the agency.

The artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk, xAI, said on Monday that it had raised $6 billion, giving the start-up a major lift as it competes with rivals, including OpenAI.

The company said on its website that it would use the money to continue building its infrastructure and accelerate research and development. BlackRock, Fidelity, Sequoia Capital and others participated in the funding round.

“A lot of compute is needed,” Mr. Musk said of the investment round in a post on X.

The fund-raising could value xAI at $35 billion to $40 billion, up from $24 billion earlier this year, The New York Times previously reported.

Mr. Musk and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Musk is trying to play catch up on A.I. The billionaire, who also leads other companies, including Tesla, X and SpaceX, publicly debuted xAI last year, well after a boom in the A.I. industry spawned dozens of products that could create text, images and even videos.

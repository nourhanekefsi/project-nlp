MJF is better than you, and you know it. To be frank, there’s not much most of us can do about that. However, we can get one small step closer to greatness for the price of $149.99 USD.

MJF is selling imitation Dynamite Diamond Rings to make him richer and make you poorer. That seems like a sound business plan.

This taste of MJF is available for purchase at the AEW online shop. Rings come in size 11, true to form of MJF’s finger. Here is a closer look at the replica jewelry.

The only material listed in the product description is zinc. For your personal sake, I hope this “cheap knockoff” ring doesn’t turn your finger green. For comedy’s sake, I hope it does. That’s like a moneymaking scheme out of Saved by the Bell.

Here’s to hoping MJF defeats Adam Cole at Worlds End to keep his Dynamite Diamond Ring and maintain the scarcity value.

If you have the cash, would you drop coin on the MJF replica ring?

Friday’s hot fire test lasted for several hours, and it appeared that Blue Origin needed to attempt the countdown several times before the successful hot fire — typical and expected hiccups for a new rocket on a new launchpad. The propellant tanks of the booster stage were filled with liquid methane and liquid oxygen, while the upper stage tanks were filled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, exactly as they would be during a launch countdown.

Jarrett Jones, senior vice president for New Glenn at Blue Origin, said in a statement that the test was “a glimpse of what’s just around the corner for New Glenn’s first launch.”

“Today’s success proves that our rigorous approach to testing — combined with our incredible tooling and design engineering — is working as intended,” he added.

New Glenn is named after John Glenn, the NASA astronaut who was the first American to circle the Earth in 1962. It is as tall as a 32-story building. It will compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets in launching commercial satellites, space probes for NASA and military spacecraft for the Defense Department.

The F.A.A. license allows Blue Origin to launch New Glenn from Cape Canaveral and land its reusable booster stage on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean. The license is valid for five years.

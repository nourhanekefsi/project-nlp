You know Mark Wahlberg for his acting roles in films such as “Daddy’s Home” and “Daddy’s Home 2.” You know him from his previous careers as a rapper and an underwear model and a violent racist, and you know him as the man behind the Wahlburger’s burger chain. But did you know Mark Wahlberg also owns a car dealership and that it’s located in Columbus, Ohio? Because he does, and it is. In fact, he appears to own several dealerships.

I somehow managed to go an entire 35 years without learning this information, but that changed today when journalist Timothy Burke posted about the unsolicited holiday promotion he received from Mark Wahlberg Buick GMC. Turns out, Max Payne from “Max Payne” really does have his hands in the car dealership business.

Did we all know this already? Have I simply been living under a rock? You’d think Mark Wahlberg owning some dealerships in Ohio would be exactly the kind of useless information my brain would hang onto for no good reason, but nope. It was news to me. In fact, you can even buy your next RV or travel trailer from Mr. Bobby Shatford himself if you’re so inclined.

For most actors, the movie money isn’t going to last forever, so it makes sense that they would look for investments outside of Hollywood. Heck, celebrities buying car dealerships isn’t new, either. Hank Aaron owned several dealerships in the state of Georgia before he died. Still, Mark Wahlberg, a noted Boston guy, owning dealerships in Ohio was surprising. Are you suddenly too good for Boston now, Mark? Maybe he just didn’t have what it took to take on ole Herb Chambers.

As best as I can tell, the real story is much less exciting and much more typically Rich Guy. According to the Detroit Free Press, Wahlberg met Jay Feldman, president and CEO of Feldman Automotive, a while ago and first got into business together when Feldman opened a few Wahlburgers franchises. He then talked Wahlberg into getting into the dealership game.

“I am continuously looking for ways to innovate my brand and engage in businesses I am passionate about,” said Wahlberg in a statement. “I love cars and the chance to work with an experienced, proven dealer-operator like Jay and represent an iconic brand like Chevrolet inspired me to get involved.”

So sadly, if you were hoping Wahlberg simply fell in love with Columbus, Ohio and decided to save it from a lack of car dealers, that’s not the case. Although the rumor that Herb Chambers ran him out of town before he could open a Boston dealership still has yet to be disproven.

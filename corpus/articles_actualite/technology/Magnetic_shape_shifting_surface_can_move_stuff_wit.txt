When you want to move an object from one place to another, you usually grab it with your hands or a robotic arm. But what if you want to move something you cannot touch without damaging or disrupting it, like a droplet of liquid? A solution proposed by a team of scientists at the North Carolina State University is a metamaterial that can change shape in response to magnetic fields.

This material had to be easily deformable to change shape, yet at the same time stiff enough to bear loads. “That seemed contradictory—how do you make something that is stiff and deformable at once?” says Jie Yin, a mechanical metamaterials researcher at NC State. His team did it with ferromagnetic elastomers, kirigami cuts, balloons, and magnets.

Refreshable Braille display

“There is not much research on using magnets to manipulate non-magnetic objects. It is very, very hard,” says Yinding Chi, another NC State researcher and lead author of the study. The idea Chi and his colleagues came up with could be compared to a refreshable Braille display. They imagined a surface dotted with domes that could rise, turn, or depress on demand, allowing it to dynamically form relief-like images or move in a pattern similar to waves in the ocean. Objects would then move on these surfaces like they were carried by waves. “This way, you can move various objects without using grippers,” Yin says.

The first step needed for manufacturing elastic domes was to use disks made with a ferromagnetic elastomer, a blend of standard flexible elastomeric material and magnetic particles. These disks, 5 millimeters in diameter and 265 microns thick, were then placed over an inflatable membrane, inflated like a balloon to form a dome, magnetized, and returned to their original flat state.

After this process, those disks would bulge or depress in response to a magnetic field. There were a few problems with this design, though.

Someone who bought a lottery ticket at a gas station in Northern California has won an estimated $1.22 billion in the Mega Millions drawing on Friday night, beating nearly impossible odds to take home one of the largest jackpots ever in the United States.

The winning ticket was sold at Sunshine Food and Gas in Cottonwood, Calif., according to the California State Lottery. The winning numbers were 3, 7, 37, 49 and 55, and the gold Mega Ball was 6.

The ticket buyerâ€™s identity was not immediately known; jackpot winners have up to a year to claim their prize. But lottery officials in California, where the names of winners are public record, are expected to announce who has won.

The winner will have the choice of taking a lump-sum payment of about $549.7 million in cash, or the entire jackpot amount in 30 annual payments.

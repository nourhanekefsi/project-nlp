A stowaway was caught aboard a Delta Air Lines plane as it was preparing to take off from Seattle for Honolulu, on Christmas Eve, the authorities said Friday, a month after a woman sneaked on to a Delta flight from New York to Paris without a ticket.

The Delta aircraft was taxiing at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport around 1 p.m. on Dec. 24 when the airline determined that someone was on board without a ticket, prompting the plane to return to the gate, Morgan Durrant, a representative for Delta, said in a statement.

When the plane arrived back at the terminal, the person believed to not have a ticket briefly thwarted the authorities by exiting the aircraft and hiding in a restroom, according to Perry Cooper, an airport spokesman.

Video surveillance eventually led officers from the Port of Seattle Police Department to the spot, and the person was “arrested for criminal trespass,” Mr. Cooper said.

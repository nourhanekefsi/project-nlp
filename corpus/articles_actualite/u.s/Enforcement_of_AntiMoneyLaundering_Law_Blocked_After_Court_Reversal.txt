Millions of corporate entities will not have to share information about their owners with the Treasury Department after an appeals court reversed a decision that would have required them to do so by Jan. 1.

Under the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money-laundering law that passed in 2020, companies would have had to turn over the identities of their “beneficial owners,” the people who own 25 percent or more of the company, or exercise significant control over it, by next year. But the law has been challenged in the courts.

Earlier this week, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit paused an injunction by a lower court, which allowed the law to go into effect.

But on Thursday, the court changed course, vacating its earlier decision “in order to preserve the constitutional status quo,” it said.

Homelessness soared to the highest level on record this year, driven by forces that included high rents, stagnant wages and a surge in migrants seeking asylum, the federal government reported on Friday.

The number of people experiencing homelessness topped 770,000, an increase of 18 percent over last year and the largest annual jump since the count began in 2007.

The report, released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed that homelessness rose by a third in the past two years, after declining modestly over the previous decade.

While the report cited multiple reasons for the recent rise, including the end of pandemic-era measures to protect the needy, Biden administration officials on a call with reporters emphasized the role of asylum-seeking migrants who overwhelmed the shelter systems where much of the increase occurred. The officials argued that, since the annual count occurred in January, the migrant crisis had begun to abate.

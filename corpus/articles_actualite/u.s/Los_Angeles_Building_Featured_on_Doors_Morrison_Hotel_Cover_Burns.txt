A boarded-up former hotel in Downtown Los Angeles that was featured on the cover of the 1970 Doors album “Morrison Hotel” was engulfed by a fire on Thursday.

The fire brought down the building’s roof but did not result in any injuries, the city’s Fire Department said.

The building, in the heart of the city’s Skid Row neighborhood, had not been used commercially for more than 15 years, the department said. But about 25 people who were homeless had been congregating inside before the fire, said Mark Dyer, the vice president of operations for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which owns the building.

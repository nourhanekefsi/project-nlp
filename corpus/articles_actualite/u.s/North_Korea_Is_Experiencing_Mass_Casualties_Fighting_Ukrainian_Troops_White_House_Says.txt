More than 1,000 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded fighting Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region in the past week, and a few chose suicide over surrender, the Biden administration said on Friday.

The heavy North Korean losses would amount to almost 10 percent of Pyongyang’s deployment figures to Russia. The announcement was the latest turn in the American effort to publicly criticize both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, for sending ill-prepared and ill-equipped troops to a foreign front line to aid Russian efforts in its war with Ukraine.

John F. Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, volunteered the latest numbers of North Korean casualties during a call with reporters. “I hope they’re loading up their commanders with a bunch of body bags, because they’re clearly going to need it,” Mr. Kirby said of the North Koreans.

Mr. Kirby said that American officials also had reports that some North Korean soldiers had killed themselves rather than surrendering to Ukrainian forces, “likely out of fear of reprisal against their families in North Korea in the event that they’re captured.” He did not elaborate on how North Korean troops might be taking their own lives but said that administration officials believed that Russian and North Korean military leaders “are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses.”

Ms. Williamson, a progressive who has endorsed reparations for slavery and called for a U.S. Department of Peace, achieved some viral debate moments in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, but dropped out of that race before the New Hampshire primary. (During that race, she described vaccine mandates as “Orwellian,” but then backtracked after facing criticism, issuing statements saying that she was “pro-vaccine.”)

In February, she suspended her second presidential run after finishing in a remote third place behind President Biden in Nevada’s Democratic primary election. In Nevada, she finished behind “none of these candidates.” She later threatened to try to challenge Vice President Kamala Harris’s nomination at the party’s convention after Mr. Biden left the race.

The Democratic Party’s 448 committee members are expected to vote for the next chair on Feb. 1.

Other candidates include Nate Snyder, who worked in the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Biden and President Barack Obama; Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota’s Democratic Party; Ben Wikler, the chair of Wisconsin’s Democratic Party; and State Senator James Skoufis of New York.

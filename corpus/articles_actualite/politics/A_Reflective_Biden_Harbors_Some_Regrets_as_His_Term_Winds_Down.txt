President Biden has less than a month to go until his one-term presidency ends, and he is feeling reflective.

He is voicing regrets about his decision not to sign his name to Covid relief checks and about his longtime reputation — once considered a virtue — of being the poorest lawmaker in Congress. And now, with a planned visit to meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican next month, the president is signaling that he may have additional issues on his mind.

The visit, White House officials said as they issued a readout on Mr. Biden’s call with the pope last week, is officially to discuss world peace. But according to a person familiar with his plans for the trip, Mr. Biden is also going to the Holy See to seek solace and “relief” as he exits the world stage. Pope Francis, that person said, has become an ally and sounding board, trading occasional phone calls with Mr. Biden. Some of those conversations have been casual check-ins of the “Hey, how you doing?” variety.

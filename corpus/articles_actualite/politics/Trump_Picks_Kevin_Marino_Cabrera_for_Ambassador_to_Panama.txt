President-elect Donald J. Trump on Wednesday named a Florida county commissioner to serve as his ambassador to Panama, a few days after Mr. Trump called for the United States to assert control over the Panama Canal.

Kevin Marino Cabrera, the District 6 commissioner of Miami-Dade County and the vice chairman of its International Trade Consortium, worked for the Trump campaign in 2020 and won Mr. Trump’s endorsement in January when he ran for vice chairman of the Florida Republican Party. This year, he served as the state’s representative to the Republican National Committee platform committee.

“Few understand Latin American politics as well as Kevin,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media. “He will do a FANTASTIC job representing our Nation’s interests in Panama!”

Mr. Trump has said the United States could demand the return of the Panama Canal if the Central American country did not reduce the fees it charges American ships. In announcing his pick of Mr. Cabrera, he accused the country of “ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dreams.”

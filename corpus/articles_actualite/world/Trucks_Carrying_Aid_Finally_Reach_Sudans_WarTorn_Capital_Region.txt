The largest convoy of food and medical aid to reach Sudan’s battered capital region since the start of the civil war finally arrived this week, the World Food Program said on Friday, bringing some relief to a country where hundreds of thousands of people are on the brink of starvation.

The 28 trucks were part of the first United Nations aid convoy since the war started more than 20 months ago to reach Jebel Aulia, a populous area south of the capital city of Khartoum, according to the World Food Program.

Humanitarian agencies have for months accused both sides in the civil war of blocking roads and threatening drivers, preventing aid supplies from getting through.

“It took three months of often daily negotiations with government authorities at all levels, and with other parties who controlled the access,” said Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative for Sudan, in a statement. “The trucks were detained on more than one occasion, and drivers were understandably reluctant given the risks involved.”

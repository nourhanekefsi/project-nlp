Security forces for Syria’s new government were pursuing at least one senior official and military forces loyal to the former dictatorship on Thursday, as they struggled to tamp down unrest in a number of regions and stabilize the country.

Government forces have been searching for Mohammed Kanjou al-Hassan, a former official in charge of military justice under the ousted president, Bashar al-Assad, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group.

In 2023, Britain imposed sanctions on Mr. al-Hassan for “his involvement in repressing the civilian population in Syria,” according to an official record that listed targets of British sanctions. Mr. al-Hassan was responsible for crimes at Syria’s notorious Sednaya prison, according to the Syrian Observatory.

An attempt to arrest Mr. al-Hassan on Wednesday set off deadly clashes in the western region around the port of Tartus — part of the heartland of Mr. al-Assad’s Alawite minority. Government security forces were ambushed by loyalists of the former government in the area, according to the Syrian Observatory.

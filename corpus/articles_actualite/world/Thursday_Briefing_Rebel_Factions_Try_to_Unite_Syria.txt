Syria’s new leaders are trying to unite rebel factions

A number of rebel factions agreed to dissolve and be integrated under the defense ministry, according to the Syrian state-run news service. Trying to establish a single national military is the latest step to consolidate control by the fighters who overthrew the country’s leader, Bashar al-Assad.

Analysts say that dissolving the rebel factions was a top priority because “wayward factions” were acting outside their command in some rural areas. The new administration has also appointed a caretaker prime minister to lead a transitional government until March 2025, and has promised that a legal committee would draft a new constitution.

Shifting gears: Pictures posted on social media on Tuesday showed Ahmed al-Shara, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that overthrew the Assad dictatorship, meeting with dozens of rebel faction leaders, many of them clad in military uniforms. Al-Shara has recently presented himself as more of a statesman than a rebel leader, and has displayed relatively moderate political positions despite his past links to Islamist extremists.

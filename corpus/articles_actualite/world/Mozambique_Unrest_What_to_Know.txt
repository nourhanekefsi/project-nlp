The southern African nation of Mozambique is reeling under its worst election-related violence since its civil war ended 32 years ago.

Since Dec. 23, when the nationâ€™s top court upheld a disputed presidential election result in favor of the candidate for the long-governing party, at least 125 people have died in street protests across the country, according to a civil society organization. That makes 252 deaths since the election in October, as protesters accusing the governing party, Frelimo, of rigging the election have repeatedly clashed with the police and soldiers.

The top opposition candidate has declared himself the actual winner of the election and has called on Mozambicans to shut down the country.

Tires have burned in the streets, buildings have been looted and vandalized, angry mobs have erected informal pay-to-pass roadblocks and hundreds of prisoners have broken free.

The dispute highlights the difficulties with data collection in Gaza that have hampered humanitarian efforts since the war began. Israel’s bombardment of the enclave, which began after a Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has forced repeated mass displacements and made it extremely difficult for aid groups to track civilians, determine their needs and, critically, gain an understanding of how much shifts in population data may reflect displacements or deaths.

Israel has said that it works hard to facilitate supplies to Gaza but that aid groups have often failed to deliver assistance because of widespread looting and lawlessness. The Biden administration warned Israel in October to let more aid in or face restrictions on military assistance. In November, it said that Israel had made important changes to improve the supply flow but that more still needed to be done.

Mr. Lew’s objection to the FEWS Net report came down to a difference in estimating the size of northern Gaza’s population. The report estimated that 65,000 to 75,000 people were still living there. Mr. Lew argued that only 7,000 to 15,000 civilians lived in the area, meaning that fewer resources would be necessary to sustain them. He said his range was based on two separate sets of data: one from the United Nations that estimated 10,000 to 15,000 civilians in the area, and another from Israeli authorities estimating 5,000 to 9,000.

The Israeli authority that coordinates the flow of goods to Gaza, known as COGAT, did not respond to requests for comment on the new food security report. But in a statement on social media on Monday, the Israeli agency disputed an unnamed recent report that it said “deliberately and inaccurately ignores the extensive humanitarian efforts made by Israel in the northern Gaza Strip” and “creates a false representation for the international community.”

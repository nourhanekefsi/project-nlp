In a year saturated with politics in an ever more polarized world, where the obituary many feared they’d be reading would be that of democracy itself, one death seemed to encapsulate the historical moment we’re in: that of Aleksei Navalny.

A man of courage who championed democracy in a country, his native Russia, that does all it can to suppress it, Mr. Navalny died in an Arctic prison as he had lived: as a ceaseless foe of authoritarianism and the nemesis of one of its most intractable practitioners, Vladimir Putin.

Mr. Navalny’s death, at 47 — coming after years of arrests, beatings and a near-fatal poisoning — set off a global wave of grief and anger, but it also did precisely what he would have wanted it to: galvanize his fellow resisters to redouble their resolve.

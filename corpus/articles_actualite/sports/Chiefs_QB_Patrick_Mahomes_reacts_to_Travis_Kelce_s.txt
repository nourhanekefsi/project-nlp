Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes continued his hot streak of efficient play during the team’s victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day. During his postgame press conference with reporters, he expressed his excitement at finally connecting with Travis Kelce on his franchise-record-breaking touchdown reception.

“I was extremely excited. I’ve been trying to get him a touchdown the last few weeks. I wanted to do it at Arrowhead. That play that Xavier almost caught last week where I was trying to throw it to him didn’t happen.” said Mahomes. “Happy we got it done in the regular season. Now we can just play football. He’s done so much for this organization on and off the field. For him to have the career that he’s had has been special. I know at the end of the day, he wants to win the ring more than anything. It’s awesome he can have that accomplishment.”

Kelce surpassed 1,000 career receptions, now owns 1,004 catches, and has passed Tony Gonzalez for the team record in touchdown receptions. He became the first player in Chiefs history to reach 1,000 career catches and was just the third tight end in NFL history to reach the mark.

In his eighth season in the NFL and his seventh as a full-time starter, Mahomes has 245 career touchdown passes, surpassing Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning for the most touchdown passes by any quarterback in his first eight years in the league.

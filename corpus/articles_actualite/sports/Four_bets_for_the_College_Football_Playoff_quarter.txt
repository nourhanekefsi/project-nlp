College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl

No. 6 Penn State (-11, 52.5) at No. 3 Boise State

Tuesday, Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m., ESPN

While the initial double-digit spread favoring Penn State may seem justified after their dominant win over SMU Mustangs, it's crucial not to overlook Boise State's potential to keep this game competitive and high scoring.

At the heart of Boise State's offensive attack is Ashton Jeanty, a running back who has evolved into a veritable force of nature. Jeanty's performance this season has been nothing short of spectacular, amassing a jaw-dropping 2,497 yards and 29 touchdowns. His ability to consistently break tackles and gain yards after contact makes him a nightmare for any defense, including the Nittany Lions.

Penn State's vulnerability to strong rushing attacks has been exposed multiple times this season. The Nittany Lions surrendered 176 yards to Ohio State Buckeyes and 189 yards to USC Trojans, demonstrating that even elite teams can find success on the ground against them. This bodes well for Jeanty and the Broncos' ground game.

However, Penn State has its own rushing duo in Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen. Singleton, known for his big-play ability, ranks 31st in explosive runs nationally. Allen compliments him perfectly with his power running style and short-yardage effectiveness. Together, they've accumulated over 4,000 yards from scrimmage and 41 touchdowns in their first two seasons, making them one of the most productive backfield tandems in college football.

The presence of three players (Jeanty, Singleton and Allen) inside the top 50 for explosive runs suggests that this game could feature numerous big plays on the ground. Singleton, in particular, ranks 11th in designed runs of 15-plus yards, highlighting the potential for chunk plays that can quickly drive up the score.

While Penn State's defense is certainly respectable, ranking 37th in defensive rushing success rate, it may not be enough to completely neutralize Jeanty and the Broncos' ground attack. If Boise State can consistently gain four yards per carry -- which would actually be a significant reduction from Jeanty's season average -- they should be able to sustain drives and put points on the board.

The total of 52.5 seems modest considering the offensive firepower on both sides. Penn State's underrated offense, ranked 9th in EPA, should have success against a Boise State defense that hasn't faced this level of competition since early in the season. Combine this with Jeanty's expected production, and we have a recipe for a high-scoring affair.

While Penn State may be favored, the explosive potential of both offenses - particularly in the running game - makes the over 52.5 points an attractive proposition. With three of the nation's top backs in terms of explosive plays on the field, this Fiesta Bowl could easily turn into a shootout that sails past the total.

Pick: OVER 52.5 points

College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl

No. 5 Texas (-14, 51.5) at No. 4 Arizona State

Wednesday, Jan. 1, 1 p.m., ESPN

The Longhorns enter the Peach Bowl carrying the weight of their storied program, but this is a great spot for the lesser-known Sun Devils to shine.

The Longhorns, despite their impressive record, have shown vulnerability, especially away from the friendly confines of Austin. Since their high-profile clash with Oklahoma Sooners, Texas has struggled to dominate opponents, outscoring them by five points per game on average, excluding one anomalous blowout victory. This trend of narrow margins raises questions about their ability to cover a substantial 14-point spread against a commanding Arizona State team.

Texas' inconsistency lies with quarterback Quinn Ewers. While capable of brilliance, Ewers has been prone to turnovers with four interceptions in his last three games, a weakness that could prove costly against the Sun Devils' opportunistic defense. Arizona State's secondary forces the fifth most interceptions, which presents a significant threat to Ewers and the Longhorns' offensive game plan.

The Sun Devils, far from being mere cannon fodder, bring a potent combination of offensive firepower and defensive prowess to Atlanta. Their quarterback, Sam Leavitt, has emerged as a revelation in his redshirt freshman year. Leavitt's accuracy (63% completion rate) and big-play ability (8.82 yards per attempt, 25% above expected) make him a dangerous adversary for the Texas defense.

Adding to Arizona State's offensive arsenal is running back Cam Skattebo. A dual-threat nightmare, Skattebo is the only back in college football to surpass both 1,000 rushing yards and 350 receiving yards in 2024. His bruising running style, combined with surprising agility and receiving skills, could pose significant problems for a Texas defense that has shown vulnerabilities against versatile offenses.

Texas' difficulties in pulling away from opponents, particularly in away games, cannot be overstated. This trend suggests that the neutral site of the Peach Bowl might not provide the Longhorns with the comfort they need to dominate. The pressure of the playoff stage, combined with Arizona State's ability to force turnovers, could level the playing field significantly.

Picking Texas feels like paying full price for the name brand, while Arizona State is the savvy discount. The Sun Devils' balanced attack, led by the efficient Leavitt and the versatile Skattebo, coupled with their defense, makes them a dangerous underdog.

The 14-point spread is generous, but games aren't won on paper or by reputation alone. The Sun Devils have the tools to not just cover the spread but potentially orchestrate an upset that could send shockwaves through the college football world.

In the pressure cooker of playoff football, where every turnover and big play is magnified, Arizona State's ability to capitalize on Texas' mistakes could be the difference. As kickoff approaches, one thing is clear: those overlooking the Sun Devils do so at their own peril. This Peach Bowl is shaping up to be a heavyweight bout, where the underdog has a puncher's chance to land the knockout blow and steal the spotlight.

Pick: Arizona State (+14)

College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl presented by Prudential

No. 8 Ohio State (-2.5, 53.5) vs. No. 1 Oregon

Wednesday, Jan. 1, 5 p.m., ESPN

Despite Ohio State's impressive 42-17 victory over Tennessee Volunteers in the first round, the line has shifted with Oregon now a 2.5-point underdog after opening as the favorite. This narrow spread speaks volumes about the respect oddsmakers have for the Ducks, even in the face of the Buckeyes' recent dominance.

Oregon's offensive firepower remains the talk of the town. Led by sixth-year quarterback Dillon Gabriel, the Ducks boast the nation's best completion percentage at 77%. Their passing attack, ranked 19th in the nation, is complemented by a potent ground game featuring Jordan James and Noah Whittington. This balanced approach has kept defenses on their toes all season.

The Ducks' receiving corps is elite, led by Tez Johnson, whose football IQ and route-running ability make him a key asset. Johnson excels at reading defenders and finding openings, akin to Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith. Johnson leads a group of talented pass-catchers that give Gabriel multiple options on every play. The Ducks' depth at receiver makes it challenging for defenses to key in on any single threat, creating mismatches across the field.

Oregon's offensive line has been a fortress, allowing only three sacks over the last five games. The protection has been pivotal for Gabriel as he dissects defenses and makes precise throws.

While Ohio State's victory over Tennessee was undoubtedly impressive, it's essential to remember that Oregon has been consistently dominant throughout the season. The Ducks' 45-37 win over Penn State in the Big Ten championship game showcased their ability to perform on the big stage. This adaptability under pressure could prove key in a high-stakes playoff matchup.

Head coach Dan Lanning's impact on the program cannot be overstated. In just two seasons, he's led Oregon to a 22-5 record, including two bowl game victories. Lanning's strategic recruiting, emphasis on team unity and ability to integrate transfers effectively have transformed the Ducks into a legitimate national championship contender.

The extra preparation time afforded by the bye week plays into Oregon's hands. Lanning and his staff have proven adept at game planning and making in-game adjustments, which could give the Ducks an edge as the game progresses.

While Ohio State's recent performance is eye-catching, I won't overreact to a single game. Oregon has been a model of consistency throughout the season, and their complete team approach makes them a formidable opponent for any team in the country.

For those who've believed in Oregon all season, including those who locked in the Ducks at +475 to win the national championship back in Week 10, there's no reason to waver now. This team has proven time and again that they have the talent, coaching, and mentality to compete with anyone. The slight underdog status might just provide the extra motivation Oregon needs to prove the doubters wrong and continue their march towards a national title.

Both teams are undeniably stacked with talent, but I put my trust in Oregon's head coach, Dan Lanning. His innovative defensive schemes and ability to adapt to different opponents set him apart. Lanning has already demonstrated his coaching abilities by outmaneuvering Ryan Day once, securing a victory against Ohio State during the regular season. While Day has struggled in high-profile matchups, posting a 2-6 record against top five teams, Lanning has shown remarkable promise in big games. Lanning's track record suggests that he might have the edge in preparing and executing a winning strategy for this crucial matchup.

This Oregon team is built for moments like these and is ready to show the world why they've been considered a top contender all season long. Like a flock of ducks flying in perfect formation, this team

Pick: Oregon (+2.5)

College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the Allstate Sugar Bowl

No. 5 Notre Dame vs. No. 2 Georgia (-2, 44.5)

Wednesday, Jan. 1, 8:45 p.m., ESPN

Once pegged as strong contenders for the national title, the Fighting Irish now face a hefty dose of adversity. The absence of star defensive lineman Rylie Mills has left a crater-sized gap in Notre Dame's game plan, tipping the scales in favor of the Bulldogs.

Notre Dame's defense, which once stood like an impenetrable fortress, now faces its most glaring vulnerability. Mills, with his 7.5 sacks and 37 tackles this season, was the cornerstone of their defensive line. Losing him now threatens the structural integrity of their pass rush and run defense. The timing couldn't be worse as they prepare to contend with Georgia's offense, which has found a bit of a surge with the electric Trevor Etienne.

Sensing an opportunity as ripe as a peach in their home state, the Bulldogs are primed to pounce. Etienne, fresh off a brilliant SEC Championship showing of 94 rushing yards and two touchdowns, is tailor-made to exploit Notre Dame's defensive shortcomings. With his versatility as a rusher and receiver, he's the multi-tool in Georgia's offensive arsenal, capable of slicing through even the staunchest of defenses -- or in this case, one now missing a critical piece.

Ironically, while Notre Dame wrestles with losing Mills, Georgia faces its own rough patch under center. With backup quarterback Gunner Stockton stepping in, the Bulldogs' air attack isn't quite the fire-breathing dragon it could be. But Mills' absence could be Stockton's blessing in disguise. With less pressure bearing down from Notre Dame's defensive front, Stockton might be more comfortable in the pocket, giving him the confidence to manage the offense effectively, which he did in Georgia's win over Texas two weeks ago.

This Sugar Bowl matchup isn't just about talent; it's a chess match of adaptability. Notre Dame's defensive coordinator, Al Golden, must find a way to turn lemons into lemonade -- possibly with an all-hands-on-deck approach to plug the defensive leaks. Meanwhile, Georgia's coaching staff can pivot toward a more conservative strategy, leaning heavily on their newfound robust ground game to protect their young quarterback.

But playoff football is rarely won on schemes alone; intangibles can play a role. For Georgia, Etienne isn't just a highlight reel waiting to happen -- his leadership and knack for clutch performances could steer the Bulldogs through the pressure cooker. For Notre Dame, their season-long resilience in overcoming hurdles may fuel an underdog spirit that keeps them fighting until the final whistle.

I had high hopes for Notre Dame to go the distance this season, but the loss of Mills feels like a gut punch at the worst possible moment. Facing a pedigreed team like Georgia without your best pass rusher is hard to overcome. I'll go with numbers over feelings and back the Bulldogs.

Pick: Georgia (-2)

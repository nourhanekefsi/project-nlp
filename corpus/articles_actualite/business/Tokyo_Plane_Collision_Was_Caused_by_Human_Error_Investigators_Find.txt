A collision between a Japan Airlines plane and a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft at a Tokyo airport a year ago appears to have been the result of multiple instances of human error, according to a report released by government investigators on Wednesday.

On Jan. 2, a nearly full Japan Airlines flight carrying passengers from Japanâ€™s northern prefecture of Hokkaido landed at Haneda Airport just as a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft, headed to help with earthquake relief in western Japan, entered the runway.

Moments later, the two planes collided and burst into flames. Through skill and luck, the flight crew of the Japan Airlines plane was able to evacuate all 367 passengers and 12 crew members. Five crew members aboard the coast guard plane were killed and its captain was severely injured.

Investigators have been looking into what happened during those few minutes leading up to the crash. Based on voice recorder audio and other evidence, the report released on Wednesday by the Japan Transport Safety Board revealed a series of overlapping human lapses.

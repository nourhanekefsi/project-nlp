The struggles have become a painful, recurring story line in Hollywood.

A script supervisor visiting a food bank every other week. The cinematographer who moved to Georgia for better filming opportunities. An art department coordinator applying for administrative jobs to cover rent.

The economic outlook of the Los Angeles area, with a population larger than most states, has been clouded in recent years by events that have upended the entertainment industry. Market saturation led to a shakeout among direct-to-streaming providers. Then the Covid-19 pandemic shut down production. And strikes by writers and actors last year went on for months, giving studios time to explore filming elsewhere, in regions that offer hefty tax incentives.

When the strikes ended, workers in Hollywood hoped their schedules would finally fill up again. But for many people, things only got worse.

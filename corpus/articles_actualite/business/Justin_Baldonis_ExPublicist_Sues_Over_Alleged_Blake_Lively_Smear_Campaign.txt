A former publicist for the actor and director Justin Baldoni filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that adds a new dimension to an alleged campaign to undermine the actress Blake Lively. The publicist, Stephanie Jones, said she was forced out of representing Mr. Baldoni and his film studio amid concerns that Ms. Lively would go public with accusations of misconduct against him.

Ms. Jones’s lawsuit, filed in New York and alleging breach of contract, follows a separate legal complaint in California on Saturday by Ms. Lively. The actress asserted that Mr. Baldoni; his film studio, Wayfarer; and their public relations representatives retaliated against her after she raised her misconduct allegations during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

Ms. Lively’s legal complaint included excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails that she had obtained through a subpoena. Ms. Jones’s lawsuit reveals that those messages came from a company phone used by one of her former employees, Jennifer Abel, who was among those Ms. Lively accused of helping to orchestrate a smear campaign against her.

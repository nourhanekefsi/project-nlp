One cold Thursday afternoon this month, the small airport in New Haven, Conn., was bustling.

A line of cars stretched from the terminal, down the main road and into a neighborhood. Inside the airport, a new, second-floor bar was crowded as passengers on the floor below walked through a gate into one of three waiting planes.

Five years ago, Tweed-New Haven Airport would have been much quieter. Back then, it hosted about a half-dozen daily flights, mostly short American Airlines jaunts to and from Philadelphia. This month, about 30 flights a day were connecting the airport to more than two dozen destinations.

The revitalization of this airport, which sits close to Long Island Sound, is a consequence of long-running industry changes that created an opportunity for a pair of start-up airlines — Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways — to fly from airports that the country’s biggest carriers have largely neglected.

“What we’re really seeing here is the next generation of industry structure and evolution,” said John Strong, a business professor at William & Mary who focuses on the airline industry.

If there’s anyone ready for retirement, it’s Alicia Munnell. She founded and has been running the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College since 1998, making it one of the leading nonpartisan think tanks examining how American workers can thrive after they leave their jobs.

“I’m very proud of this center,” Ms. Munnell said. “We have great people and really good academics who really care.”

She served on former President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers and was assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy in his administration. Previously, she spent 20 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, where she rose to become senior vice president and director of research.

Ms. Munnell, 82, is retiring at the end of December, when Andrew Eschtruth, the center’s deputy director, will take over. Before she departs, she talked about her career and the projected shortfall that would leave Social Security, the cornerstone of the American retirement system, unable to pay full scheduled benefits after 2033. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

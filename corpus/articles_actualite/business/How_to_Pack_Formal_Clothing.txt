The holidays are here, which means many of us will soon be trying to squeeze our best festive attire into airline-approved bags. So how to make sure your precious dresses, suits and heels arrive in tip-top shape? Checking a bag means you’ll have room for a variety of dressy outfits. But if all you need are a few, you can travel light, as many business travelers do. Whether you choose to check or carry-on, here’s how to pack formal wear like the pros so you can spend the season celebrating rather than ironing.

Suits and shirts

Plastic dry cleaning bags are the unsung heroes of packing. “Don’t throw them away,” said Jeremy Wood Beaumont, the founder of Rhodes-Wood, which sells “modern classic” men's wear in Harrogate, in northern England. Utilizing dry cleaning bags, he said, “stops so much creasing.”

Mr. Beaumont learned that trick when he worked in a clothing factory and, over more than four decades in the business, he’s found that properly folding garments can save time and headaches when you arrive at your destination.

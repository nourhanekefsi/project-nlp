Part of doing any job well involves getting feedback, and that’s also true for my position as the Work Friend columnist for The New York Times, which I have been for the past six months. Over that time, I’ve received dozens of incisive, critical, thought-provoking and sometimes even vaguely insulting responses, most of which have made me think — and in some cases rethink — my answers to questions that I’d chosen to respond to in this column.

For this last column of 2024, I thought I’d do a little something different and share some of that feedback from readers — good and bad — not just about my answers, but about some of the questions themselves.

A column that prompted one of the biggest responses was my very first, published on July 7 (“Dropping In Just to Say Hi!”), in which a questioner expressed discomfort over a colleague’s habit of initiating conversations on Slack with just a “hello” and no follow-up. My response empathized with the letter writer’s frustrations — I even called the practice of saying “hi” accompanied by silence “creepy.” And a lot of readers had something to say about it, much of it smart.

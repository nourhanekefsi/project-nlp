Big Tech and big government

The flow of Silicon Valley executives President-elect Donald Trump wants to join his administration is becoming a torrent after he announced more picks over the weekend.

It’s the latest evidence of tech heavyweights’ growing influence on Washington, and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is at the center of it.

Trump tapped a pair of the V.C.’s executives to high-profile roles. He named Scott Kupor, a managing partner at the firm, to be director of the Office of Personnel Management — a role that could make him crucial to streamlining staffing across the federal government.

Trump also appointed Sriram Krishnan, until recently a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, to advise on artificial intelligence policy. Krishnan is a confidant of Elon Musk, and host of a widely followed tech podcast with his wife. Krishnan will work with David Sacks, the Silicon Valley investor who was an early backer of Trump, and who has been named the White House crypto and A.I. czar.

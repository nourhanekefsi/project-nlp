About one million taxpayers who were eligible for a pandemic-era tax credit in 2021 but did not claim it can expect a lump sum from the Internal Revenue Service in the coming weeks.

The I.R.S. announced on Friday that it would start sending automatic payments of up to $1,400 to those who qualified for the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit but did not properly claim it on their tax return. The agency estimates it will send about $2.4 billion out to taxpayers by the end of January.

Danny Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner, said the payments came after the agency reviewed its internal data and noticed that about a million taxpayers overlooked the “complex credit” when filing in 2021. He said in a statement that taxpayers would not be required to amend their filings and would receive their payments automatically.

Who qualifies for the credits

The 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit was meant for those who did not receive a third stimulus check distributed by the federal government after the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns.

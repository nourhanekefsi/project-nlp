Here’s the first thing to remember about withdrawing retirement money: It’s all about the cash flow.

The second thing? You might want to get some help managing it.

America is hitting a phase some experts call Peak 65, with more than four million people turning 65 in 2024, 2025 and 2026. According to one survey, that’s an average of 11,200 people every day each of those years. Whether they’re retiring or getting ready to retire, a huge number of workers will need to significantly change how they think about their finances.

After decades of building a nest egg, retirees must suddenly switch to making sure that money lasts for nearly 30 years — or even longer.

“While you’re working, what we prioritize is building net worth over time, aiming for the highest net worth possible,” said Mike Crews, a certified financial planner and chief executive of North Texas Wealth Management in Allen, Texas. “When you retire, it’s no longer about that, it’s realizing that retirement is all about cash flow. That’s a total mind shift for people.”

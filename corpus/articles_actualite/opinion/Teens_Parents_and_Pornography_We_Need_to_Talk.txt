Re “Talk to My Teens About Porn? Yes, Experts Say. It’s Needed,” by Matt Richtel (front page, Dec. 14):

I am the president and C.E.O. of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, which champions sexual freedom as a fundamental human right. Your article echoes our longstanding concerns: Despite widespread pornography consumption, including by youth, society remains unable to discuss it openly because of rampant censorship.

For 20 years, Woodhull has led honest conversations about pornography, debunking myths with our “Fact Checked by Woodhull” research. Yet the discomfort persists. Scholars report adults’ reluctance to discuss pornography with young people, reflecting a broader unease with sex and sexuality topics.

This discomfort underscores the urgent need for comprehensive sexuality education in schools. However, we face increasing censorship online and in classrooms, stifling these vital conversations and infringing on young people’s rights to education and sexual health information.

We must break this silence; it’s time to advocate comprehensive sexuality education and challenge censorship efforts. Moreover, we need to empower adults to engage in open dialogues about sex, sexuality and pornography with youth.

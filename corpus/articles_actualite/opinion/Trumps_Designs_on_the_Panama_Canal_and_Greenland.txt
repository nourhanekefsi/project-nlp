Re “Trump’s Wish to Control Greenland and Panama Canal: This Time It’s Not a Joke” (news article, Dec. 24):

In advance of taking office, President-elect Donald Trump, with his customary bluster and threats, has been laying the groundwork for returning the United States to its expansionist past with serious designs on Panama and Greenland, coupled with, hopefully, only frivolous talk about annexing Canada.

The governments of these sovereign countries have understandably not taken kindly to Mr. Trump’s harsh rhetoric and would surely resist any threat to their autonomy.

Apparently determined to reclaim the Panama Canal, which the United States ceded by treaty to Panama and whose use we have shared with other nations for many decades, Mr. Trump is asserting that the United States — with enviably the world’s largest economy — is being treated “unfairly” by the government of Panama due to high canal usage fees.

It’s not clear how serious the president-elect is about these schemes of acquisition, but his pre-inaugural authoritarian rhetoric has already set a tone of confrontation and chaos, especially regarding Panama.

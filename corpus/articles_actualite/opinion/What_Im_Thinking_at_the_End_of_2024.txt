Ezra Klein: Happy holidays. Welcome to “Ask Me Anything” and the near end of a year that has felt like many, many, many years.

We thought before it all ends, we would answer a couple more questions — hopefully slightly more fun ones than those that are more election focused. And then we’re going to be back with new episodes in the new year and have some stuff that I’m pretty excited about in the pipeline.

But thank you to everybody who’s been listening this year. It has been a ride.

Thank you to Claire Gordon, who’s here with me and has been an amazing partner in building the show this year and editing it and getting things out at the last minute. To her and to the team. They’ve all been incredible about getting the show out the door. With as fast as news was moving, it was no small thing and took no small number of long nights.

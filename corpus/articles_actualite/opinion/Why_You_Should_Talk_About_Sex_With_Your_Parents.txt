Most of us would probably rather die than talk with family about our sex lives. But in the Opinion video above, adult children and parents illuminate a path for having frank conversations about sex.

This film begins with all the giggly, seat-squirming cringe you might expect. But once the awkwardness subsides, the film quickly reveals something more profound: loved ones sharing real, meaningful moments from their lives. Sexuality offers life lessons about confidence, trauma and happiness. The film asks the viewer to imagine other conversations left unspoken, from family finances to death.

For several years, the Brazilian directors Paula Sacchetta and Renan Flumian have been exploring the topic of sexuality, with a short film documenting the sex lives of older people, which became a five-part series on a major streaming network in Brazil. The directors were struck by how taboo the subject of sex remains within families. The lost opportunity for intimacy saddened them.

So for the video above, they provided questions to facilitate conversation and filmed as their subjects took the plunge.

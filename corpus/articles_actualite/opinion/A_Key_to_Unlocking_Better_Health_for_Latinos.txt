A lack of medical coverage is hurting the quality of life for millions of people in America, and Latinos have been disproportionately affected. They are among the least likely to have health insurance, they are more likely to die from diabetes than non-Hispanic white Americans, and they are less likely to have routine medical examinations or get treatment for debilitating conditions, a disparity that was exacerbated during the Covid pandemic. That’s why improving access to health insurance is a major focus of the Hispanic Federation, an organization that supports Latino communities through education, advocacy and funding for other nonprofits.

In New York State, the organization has helped about 155,000 households enroll in free or low-cost health insurance coverage. Its program coordinators work with people who are longtime residents, as well as with immigrants who have recently arrived and speak little English. The health care system is already full of obstacles to coverage, not least navigating enrollment. Language barriers add yet another layer of complexity for those seeking care. The federation helps Latinos through these obstacles by guiding them through the process, and this work is supported by The New York Times Communities Fund.

The Hispanic Federation was founded in 1990 in New York City to serve the needs of the city’s Latino residents. Today it serves Hispanic people nationally, and raising awareness about public health issues has long been a central effort. One initiative, created in 1995, helped to address the disproportionate spread of H.I.V. and AIDS in New York’s Latino communities in part by educating people about H.I.V. testing.

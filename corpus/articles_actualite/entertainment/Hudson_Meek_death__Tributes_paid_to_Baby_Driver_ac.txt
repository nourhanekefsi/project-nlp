Baby Driver teenage actor dies after falling from moving vehicle

Tributes have been paid to Baby Driver actor Hudson Meek, who died after falling from a moving vehicle in Alabama.

The 16-year-old actor also appeared in TV series including the NBC drama Found and did video game and commercial voice-overs.

Meek fell from a vehicle in Vestavia Hills, a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, on 19 December, authorities said. He sustained blunt force trauma in the fall and died of his injuries two days later.

"His 16 years on this earth were far too short, but he accomplished so much and significantly impacted everyone he met," his mother Lani Wells Meek posted on Facebook.

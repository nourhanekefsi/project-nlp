Cecilia Sala is being held in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, according to her newspaper Il Foglio.

Cecilia Sala, an Italian journalist for the newspaper Il Foglio, was arrested in Iran earlier in the month, Italy’s foreign ministry announced on Friday.

The arrest took place on Dec. 19 but was only made public by authorities today. The ministry said that the Italian ambassador to Iran Paola Amadei visited the journalist in detention to verify the conditions in which she was being held.

Sala, 29, has covered Iran extensively in the past and recently released an episode of her podcast “Stories,” in which she interviewed Zeinab Musavi, an Iranian standup comic who has spoken against the compulsory wearing of the hijab in her videos. Musavi was imprisoned earlier this year but has since been released.

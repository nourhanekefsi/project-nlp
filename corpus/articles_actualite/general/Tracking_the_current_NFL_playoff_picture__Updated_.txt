What to Watch

With two weeks left in the season, there are still five playoff spots (two in the AFC, three in the NFC) and five division titles there for the taking. Plus, the No. 1 seed hasn't been clinched in the NFC. We're tracking the closest, most interesting races live during Week 17 (and then again in Week 18). We have you covered through all the swings, big plays and surprises.

We begin with the AFC wild-card picture. Saturday's three-game slate has big implications; either the seven-team field could be set by the end of the day, or things could get interesting quickly.

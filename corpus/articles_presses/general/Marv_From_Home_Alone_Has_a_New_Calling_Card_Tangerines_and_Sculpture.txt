The end of the year may be associated with the holiday season for many, but Daniel Stern refers to it as something else: the “Home Alone” time.

Stern, 67, best known for playing one of the not-so-wily Wet Bandits in the movie, has been an actor in Hollywood for more than 40 years. These days he is a prolific bronze sculptor and helps around his family’s ranch and citrus orchard in Ventura County, Calif., where he dazzles his six grandchildren with the trademark physical comedy he used in two “Home Alone” movies, as well as in “City Slickers” and “Bushwhacked.”

But you probably know him better as Marv.

The buffoonish yin to Harry’s scheming yang (Joe Pesci), the two taunt and rob an affluent Chicago neighborhood during Christmastime in “Home Alone,” only to be thwarted by 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) and his booby traps. The movie, and its sequel, quickly became part of the Christmas movie canon.

“Home Alone” has remained a classic through generations, something Stern finds “mind-boggling” and “humbling.” But fans from the 1990s are now enthralled by a different kind of storytelling: Stern is documenting daily life on his farm on social media, bringing his Instagram and TikTok followers along for his tangerine harvest and juicing, and offering a behind-the-scenes look at his art studio.

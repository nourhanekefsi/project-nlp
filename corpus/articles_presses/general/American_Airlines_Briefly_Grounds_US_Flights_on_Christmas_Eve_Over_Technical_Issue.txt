“Our team is currently working to get this done,” American Airlines said on X. “An estimated time frame has not been provided, but they’re trying to fix it in the shortest possible time.”

The ground stop, though only for an hour, could result in heavy delays during what’s expected to be a record holiday travel time. Tens of millions of people fly during the period from mid-December to shortly after New Year’s Day. The Federal Aviation Administration said it expected more than 31,000 flights on Christmas Eve.

The airline is the largest carrier in the United States by number of seats, according to OAG, an aviation data provider. It has more than 3,300 domestic flights scheduled on Tuesday and 581 international departures, according to Cirium, an aviation data company.

Some passengers took the problem in stride. Mary Hardy, 64, was waiting at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport for her flight to Newark when the delay was announced. She said she was disappointed, but she acknowledged that mishaps were to be expected during holiday travel.

“We should have known flying out Christmas Eve that something could happen,” she said. “You just have to be prepared.”

A day after a man died beneath ocean-swept debris and another man went missing along the California coast, officials warned people on Tuesday to stay away from many of the state’s beaches because of an unusually powerful surf that arrived just before the holidays.

The thrashing of Pacific Ocean waves on Monday also caused part of an iconic wooden pier in Santa Cruz, Calif., to collapse, sending three people into the sea, along with a large bathroom structure. The individuals were rescued and did not suffer serious injuries, according to the city’s mayor.

Dangerous surf pounded California beaches on Monday with waves up to 40 feet tall, and they were even bigger in some locations, including the Mavericks surf break off Half Moon Bay, a spot known for its big waves, 15 miles south of San Francisco.

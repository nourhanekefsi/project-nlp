After his first marriage ended, the chef Nick Anderer vowed to himself that he would never marry again. But “I’m a hopeless romantic,” he said one Thursday morning at his West Village restaurant, Anton’s, where he showed me how he makes his olive-oil mashed potatoes. Whenever I tell people I like to eat those Anton’s potatoes for dinner with a glass of wine and a good book, I have to repeat myself to emphasize: I like to eat just those potatoes for dinner. They are, truly, the best mashed potatoes I’ve ever had.

Mashed potatoes don’t ever mean to be the star, but like Michelle Williams in any of her character-acting roles, sometimes they’re the supernova. A pristine emulsion of liquid, starch and fat, the mashed potatoes at Anton’s — called “whipped potatoes” to reflect their light, fluffy texture — come in a shallow dish, where they level out like an infinity pool of spud. Bright green extra-virgin olive oil from Castelvetrano, a town in Sicily, thinly outlines the sides of the dish, adding not just richness but peppery intrigue. A single bay leaf sticks out, hinting to its presence. You could eat these potatoes with a spoon, but a fork allows you to linger between bites.

To prepare couscous, follow these simple steps:

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup couscous
- 1 cup boiling water or broth (for added flavor)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter (optional)
- Salt (to taste)

### Instructions:

1. **Boil the liquid:**
   - In a saucepan, bring 1 cup of water or broth to a boil. If you prefer, you can add a pinch of salt for seasoning.

2. **Add couscous:**
   - Once the water or broth is boiling, remove it from heat. Add 1 cup of couscous to the saucepan, and stir briefly to ensure it's evenly distributed.

3. **Cover and let it steam:**
   - Cover the saucepan with a lid and let the couscous steam for about 5 minutes. During this time, the couscous will absorb the liquid and soften.

4. **Fluff the couscous:**
   - After 5 minutes, uncover the saucepan and use a fork to fluff the couscous gently. This will separate the grains and give it a light, fluffy texture.

5. **Add olive oil or butter (optional):**
   - You can add a tablespoon of olive oil or butter to make the couscous richer and more flavorful. Stir it in after fluffing.

6. **Serve:**
   - Your couscous is now ready! You can serve it as a side dish or use it in various recipes such as salads, stews, or with vegetables and meats.

Enjoy your couscous!

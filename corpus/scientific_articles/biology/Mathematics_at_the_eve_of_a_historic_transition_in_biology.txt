A century ago physicists and mathematicians worked in tandem and established
quantum mechanism. Indeed, algebras, partial differential equations, group
theory, and functional analysis underpin the foundation of quantum mechanism.
Currently, biology is undergoing a historic transition from qualitative,
phenomenological and descriptive to quantitative, analytical and predictive.
Mathematics, again, becomes a driving force behind this new transition in
biology.

Quantum Biology is emerging as a new field at the intersection between
fundamental physics and biology, promising novel insights into the nature and
origin of biological order. We discuss several elements of QBCL (Quantum
Biology at Cellular Level), a research program designed to extend the reach of
quantum concepts to higher than molecular levels of biological organization.
  Key words. decoherence, macroscopic superpositions, basis-dependence, formal
superposition, non-classical correlations, Basis-Dependent Selection (BDS),
synthetic biology, evolvability mechanism loophole.

While it is understood by women that tech fluency might act as a powerful
career accelerator or even a new career direction towards software engineering,
this awakening often comes after graduation from a different field, when it is
difficult for the women to make the shift towards tech and computing. In this
paper, we report on our experience with running a successful education
non-profit called Czechitas, which shows that women in their 20s and 30s are
(maybe surprisingly) highly interested in learning tech, they just need a
helping hand and tailored assistance, encouragement and guidance.

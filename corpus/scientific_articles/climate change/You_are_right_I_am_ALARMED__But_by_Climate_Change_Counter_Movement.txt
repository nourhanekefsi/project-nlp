The world is facing the challenge of climate crisis. Despite the consensus in
scientific community about anthropogenic global warming, the web is flooded
with articles spreading climate misinformation. These articles are carefully
constructed by climate change counter movement (cccm) organizations to
influence the narrative around climate change. We revisit the literature on
climate misinformation in social sciences and repackage it to introduce in the
community of NLP. Despite considerable work in detection of fake news, there is
no misinformation dataset available that is specific to the domain.of climate
change. We try to bridge this gap by scraping and releasing articles with known
climate change misinformation.

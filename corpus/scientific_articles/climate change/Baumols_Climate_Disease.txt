We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium
climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the
production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon
can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we
distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate
vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability
results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if
climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact
can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less
(more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not
only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost
and climate diseases.

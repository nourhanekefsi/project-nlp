Steve Cohen is fast approaching a billion-dollar outlay this offseason, and the Mets’ work isn’t done.

The Amazin’s brought back one of their breakout stars of the 2024 season, agreeing to a three-year, $75 million contract with Sean Manaea early Monday morning.

That brings the Mets’ free-agent spending to $916.25 million, with $765 million of that going to Juan Soto.

Add in the additional $40 million Soto could get if the Mets void his opt-out clause after the fifth year of the 15-year deal, and that number increases to $956.25 million.

The smaller signings of utilityman Jared Young and pitcher Justin Hagenman bring the total to $958.25 million.

That number is going to go up more, as the Mets still have to finalize their infield plans.

There appears to be a greater likelihood that the team and Pete Alonso agree on a pact to keep the first baseman in Flushing, given the Yankees opted for a one-year, $12.5 million contract with Paul Goldschmidt, Christian Walker signed a three-year, $60 million contract with the Astros and the Diamondbacks acquired Josh Naylor from the Guardians, who reunited with Carlos Santana to replace Naylor.

An alternative would be adding a third baseman, perhaps Alex Bregman, and moving Mark Vientos to first.

The Mets also figure to try to add more bullpen help and could use a versatile infielder in the vein of Jose Iglesias, the team’s “OMG” hero who remains a free agent.

So there is a path for the Mets to repeat what the Dodgers did last year with their billion-plus spent in free agency and reach a 10-figure winter.

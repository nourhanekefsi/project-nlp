The Texans have narrowed Saturday’s game against the Chiefs in the third quarter, but a player likely suffered a costly injury in the process. And in the emotion of it, the Texans may have made a special teams error.
Tank Dell caught a 30-yard touchdown from C.J. Stroud on a deep pass to the back of the end zone. But Dell took a shot to his knee while catching it from teammate Jared Wayne, suffering an apparent serious injury.
Dell immediately signaled that he’d suffered a knee injury while on the field. The NBC broadcast showed an emotional Stroud, who had clearly realized what had happened.
Dell was loaded onto a stretcher and an ambulance cart, as an emotional Stroud watched from the back of the end zone.
Dell had a strong rookie season in 2023 that was cut short by a broken leg.
But after Dell exited the field, Ka’imi Fairbairn missed the extra point to keep the score at 17-16, Chiefs.
UPDATE 3:10 p.m. ET: Dell has been ruled out with a knee injury.

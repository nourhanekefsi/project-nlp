Texans wide receiver Tank Dell is looking at a lengthy road back to the playing field.

Dell was injured in Saturday’s loss to the Chiefs and head coach DeMeco Ryans confirmed on Monday that he dislocated his kneecap. Ryans also announced that Dell tore his ACL when he collided with a teammate while making a touchdown catch.

The timing of the injuries — Ryans said there was other damage as well — will make it likely that Dell is sidelined into the 2025 season. It’s an unfortunate turn of events for a player who broke his leg during his rookie season in 2023 and for a team that already lost wideout Stefon Diggs to a torn ACL this year.

Dell had 51 catches for 667 yards and three touchdowns this season. Nico Collins, John Metchie, Xavier Hutchinson, Robert Woods, and Jared Wayne are the remaining receivers on the 53-man roster in Houston.

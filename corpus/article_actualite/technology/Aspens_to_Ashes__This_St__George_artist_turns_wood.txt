ST. GEORGE â€” From Celtic knot teardrop earrings to intricate coasters and tabletop art, this St. George artist uses her fiery touch and artistic flair to transform wood into one-of-a-kind creations.

"It's kind of my quiet zen," said Kira Johnson, the creator and owner behind Aspens to Ashes. "Sometimes I'll play music that connects to the person I'm creating for or the piece I'm working on. It helps set the tone and bring the art to life."

Johnson's art is crafted through pyrography, the technique of decorating wood by burning designs onto its surface with a heated tool. This turns each piece into a work of art drawn with fire.

Her creations range from intricate earrings and coasters to large-scale art pieces, Christmas ornaments and soon-to-come necklaces with wood-burned pendants accented by crystals. She also crafts clocks, versatile trivets that double as artistic keyholders, wooden tic-tac-toe games and more. Some trivets are even food-safe, like a festive Christmas design perfect for kids to leave treats on for Santa.

Her signature style blends two worlds into one, featuring an outer animal silhouette with the outline of another animal nestled inside. Inspired by nature, Johnson's creations showcase rustic, outdoor-inspired designs, often highlighting creatures like owls, bison, wolves and more.

"I've been exploring a lot of predator-prey themes," she said, gesturing to her artwork on the table. "This one features an owl, but if you look closely, you'll spot a hidden bobcat. I also incorporated trees and the moon within the owl's belly."

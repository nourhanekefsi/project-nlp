Deals Samsung Google

Amazon has great discounts on flagship devices from Samsung and Google as we prepare for the holidays and to wave goodbye to 2024.
The Samsung Galaxy S24 is currently $200 off – and so is the Google Pixel 9. This means that the 128GB models cost the same. If you haven’t decided which one is better for you, consult our Galaxy S24 vs. Pixel 9 article for an in-depth comparison.
Long story short, the Pixel lacks a telephoto camera and has lower performance, but it has better main and ultra-wide cameras, plus longer battery life.
A better alternative may be the Google Pixel 9 Pro. This one does have a tele camera – a 48MP 113mm module that reaches far beyond what the 10MP 67mm module on the Galaxy can. The performance isn’t any better (all Pixel 9 phones use the same Tensor G4), but the difference in RAM capacity is hard to ignore (the Pixel has double the RAM!).
There is also the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, but this is a large phone (6.8” display, 5,060mAh battery) that is aimed at the Galaxy S24 Ultra instead.
We are changing gears and will look at tablets next. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ is $350 off right now, so it starts at $1,000. This 12.4” slate is rated IP68 and is powered by the Dimensity 9300+ instead of the traditional Snapdragon.
You can go even bigger with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, which has a 14.6” display (120Hz OLED). It’s practically laptop-sized and you can indeed use it as a tablet with the optional keyboard cover ($160).
You can’t go smaller, though, not with the Tab S10 generation. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is still around, an 11” tablet from last year with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Only the 8/128GB variant is available and while you can’t do anything about the RAM, the storage can be expanded with a microSD card.

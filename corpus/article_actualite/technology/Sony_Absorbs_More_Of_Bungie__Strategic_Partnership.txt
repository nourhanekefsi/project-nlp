Bungie’s Strategic Partnerships team has officially transitioned to PlayStation’s Franchise Development division, marking another step in Bungie’s deeper integration with Sony.
Bungie’s integration with Sony is showing no signs of slowing down. In the past year, we’ve seen major changes at the studio, known for games like Destiny 2 and the upcoming Marathon, with several Bungie teams transitioning to PlayStation.
The entire Creative Studios team joined PlayStation earlier this year, and now another major shift has been confirmed: Bungie’s Strategic Partnerships team is officially part of PlayStation’s Franchise Development and Portfolio Strategy division.
These changes come at a tough time for Bungie. After the second round of layoffs earlier this year, the studio has been working to align more closely with Sony’s goals for live-service games. Bungie remains committed to its projects, including Destiny 2 and the upcoming extraction shooter Marathon.
This news comes from Joss Price, who has been leading Bungie’s Strategic Partnerships team since 2021. In a LinkedIn post, Price announced that his team had officially moved to PlayStation’s Franchise Development and Portfolio Strategy division. 
He shared his excitement about the new role and reflected on his time at Bungie and the opportunities ahead with Sony. Price wrote, “After three amazing years at Bungie, my team has transitioned across to the mothership at PlayStation.”
“There are too many people to thank at that inspirational studio, but I’d be remiss not to call out Justin Truman, Joshua Deane, and Gary Clay for their guidance, support, and kindness. My experience at Bungie remains a career highlight and I’m deeply appreciative for the opportunity to play a small part in its history.”
He continued, “Moving forward, we couldn’t be more excited to join the Franchise Development and Portfolio Strategy division, led by Tim Kamienski and Asad Qizilbash. On a personal level, this is genuinely a dream role, helping to transform PlayStation’s global portfolio of gaming IP into entertainment franchises.”
“I can’t wait to get stuck in and roll up my sleeves. Here’s to the next 30 years of play, there’s so much to look forward to…”
This is part of Bungie deepening its integration with Sony PlayStation, as announced by CEO Pete Parsons earlier this year. “[We are] working to integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12%, into SIE over the next few quarters,” Parsons said.
In related news, Bungie has reportedly reduced its workforce by over 700 employees in a year, leaving approximately 850 team members actively working on Destiny 2 and the upcoming Marathon, slated for a 2025 release.

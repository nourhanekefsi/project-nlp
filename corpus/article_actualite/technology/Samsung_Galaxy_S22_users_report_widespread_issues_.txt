A hot potato: A significant software update is causing problems for some Samsung Galaxy S22 users, according to complaints shared on user forums and social media. The update in question, One UI 6.1, which rolled out in September, has reportedly triggered a range of issues, from display glitches to complete device failure. 
Many users report their phones becoming trapped in boot loops, rendering them unusable. Some describe jerky display performance, while others face more severe issues that effectively "brick" their devices.
One frustrated user shared his experience on Samsung's support forum, detailing how his perfectly functional phone suddenly stopped working after the update. Despite attempting various troubleshooting methods suggested by Samsung, including cache clearing and factory resets, the issue persisted. The user's experience mirrors countless others reported across various platforms, including Reddit, Twitter, and Samsung's own forums.
After One UI 6.1.1, my Galaxy S22 Ultra is stuck in a bootloop. Service says it's a motherboard issue but there is no physical damage. As a loyal user of 4 Samsung devices, I'm losing trust. @SamsungMobile what now?"@SamsungIndia @tarunvats33 @stufflistings pic.twitter.com/PJ9xQpEy8O
In response to these reports, Samsung issued an initial statement to Notebookcheck, indicating that they are investigating the user feedback. The company stated that potential warranty claims would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. However, this approach has left many users dissatisfied, especially those facing high repair costs.
To add to the frustration, some users claim that Samsung has attributed the issue to defective mainboards, which require repairs not covered under warranty. This has led to accusations that Samsung is unfairly blaming consumers for what appears to be a software-induced problem.
The reported issues point to a potential incompatibility between the new software and the existing hardware or firmware of the S22 models. The prevalence of boot loops suggests a critical failure in the devices' ability to properly initialize the OS after the update.
Samsung released the One UI 6.1.1 update for the Galaxy S22 series earlier this year, introducing new features and improvements. The update focuses heavily on AI-powered capabilities. The camera and gallery applications received several enhancements, like Live Effects for 3D photos, a Motion Clipper for creating stickers and GIFs, and a Portrait Studio with AI-generated styles.
The update also adds a Sketch to Image function for incorporating AI-generated elements into photos, and an Overlay Translation feature for text within images. Live Translate has been extended to third-party apps, while Smart Select now offers context-based suggestions.
Additional changes include optimizations to video playback in the built-in player, a new option to answer calls by tapping buttons, more frequent weather updates, and enhancements to the Auto Blocker security feature.

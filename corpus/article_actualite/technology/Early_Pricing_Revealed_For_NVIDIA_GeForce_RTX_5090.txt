NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 & RTX 5080 GPU prices have been revealed as a part of the Acer Predator Orion Desktop PC. The price difference looks quite high, but it is a bit early to say this would be the case when the cards are launched. The actual price difference between the two cards will possibly be much lower if bought individually.
A few days ago, we reported that Acer had prepared its next-generation gaming desktops with the upcoming NVIDIA Blackwell gaming GPUs. These are the GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080-based systems, belonging to the Predator Orion 7000 series. Even though the official pricing and availability aren't known yet, we have an estimated price for these configurations, thanks to the latest leak by Notebookcheck.
The online German retailer OTTO listed the PCs, revealing the early prices. The Predator Orion 7000, featuring the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K, 32 GB DDR5 memory, 1TB of storage, and an RTX 5090 was listed at €4,699 or US$4900. This includes the 20% VAT, so the actual price for the NA market is around $4080. The other configuration, which includes the same parts except for the GPU, boasts the RTX 5080 and was listed at €3,499 or US$3649 including VAT. Therefore, the actual amount is roughly $3040.
The price difference between these two configurations comes at a whopping $1040 when VAT is excluded and about $1250 when we consider the current German prices.
This doesn't necessarily mean that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is going to be $1000-$1250 more expensive than the RTX 5080, but considering the recent rumors, we may see an increased price gap between these two cards compared to what we saw between the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080.
If you are trying to guess the prices of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080, one way is to subtract the prices of all other components in the Acer Predator desktops from the total price and the other way is to compare the cost increase over the previous gen desktop models, which came with the RTX 4090 and 4080. Either way, you may get an estimate that should come out to be a few hundred dollars higher for the RTX 5090 over the 4090. But in no way, is this going to represent the exact price of either of the RTX 50 cards.
We will have to wait till the launch date to get the exact MSRPs of these GPUs for both NA and EU markets. The launch will happen at the CES 2025 event, and we will probably see the upgraded Acer Predator Orion 7000 desktops soon on the market.
